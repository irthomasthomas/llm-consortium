This page details design patterns for dashboards, covering component design, composition, and layout. It categorizes patterns based on data information, meta information, visual representations, interactivity, screenspace, structure, page layout, and color schemes.

There are no explicit design patterns mentioned for "AI interaction dashboards" in the document. However, the Interaction section outlines general patterns that could be relevant:

**Interactions**

This group describes common interaction approaches found within the dashboards.

Exploration interactions allow users to explore data elements and the relations between them.

Navigation interactions enable designers to direct users through facets of information in a particular order.

Personalization interactions allow users to redefine and reconfigure the information shown within a dashboard.

Filter and Focus interactions allow users to find or focus on specific data, e.g., by searching for particular data values or applying filter criteria so that only relevant information remains.

This arXiv page displays information about a computer science paper titled "Dashboard Design Patterns" by Benjamin Bach and others, submitted on May 2, 2022, and revised on August 24, 2022. The paper introduces design patterns for dashboards aimed at informing dashboard design processes based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards and insights from a design workshop.

> Abstract:This paper introduces design patterns for dashboards to inform dashboard design processes. Despite a growing number of public examples, case studies, and general guidelines there is surprisingly little design guidance for dashboards. Such guidance is necessary to inspire designs and discuss tradeoffs in, e.g., screenspace, interaction, or information shown. Based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards, we report on eight groups of design patterns that provide common solutions in dashboard design. We discuss combinations of these patterns in dashboard genres such as narrative, analytical, or embedded dashboard. We ran a 2-week dashboard design workshop with 23 participants of varying expertise working on their own data and dashboards. We discuss the application of patterns for the dashboard design processes, as well as general design tradeoffs and common challenges. Our work complements previous surveys and aims to support dashboard designers and researchers in co-creation, structured design decisions, as well as future user evaluations about dashboard design guidelines.
