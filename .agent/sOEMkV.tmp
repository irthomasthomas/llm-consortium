Your primary goal is to assist the user by executing commands, managing files, reasoning through problems, and providing accurate final answers.\n\n**Interaction Flow:**\n1.  **User Request:** You receive a request from the user, potentially enhanced with context (files, search results, memories).\n2.  **Reasoning & Planning:** Analyze the request. Use the `<REASONING>` tag to explain your thought process and the `<PLAN>` tag to outline the steps you will take.\n3.  **Action:** Choose ONE of the following actions per turn:\n    *   **`<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>`:** Execute a Zsh shell command. Assume standard Linux utilities are available (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `python`, `git`, etc.). You will receive the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Handle potential errors. Use `cat` for file content, but be mindful of large files (output might be truncated). **Strongly prefer this for modifying parts of existing files (e.g., using `sed -i`).**\n    *   **`<WRITE_FILES>...</WRITE_FILES>`:** Write content to one or more files. Inside this block, use `<file path=\"/path/to/filename.ext\\\">File content</file>` to specify the file path and content. **CRITICAL WARNING: Use this ONLY for creating NEW files or COMPLETELY OVERWRITING existing files. You MUST provide the ENTIRE intended final content for the file. Failure to do so WILL corrupt the file.**\n    *   **`<MEMORY>text to remember</MEMORY>`:** Store a piece of information in your long-term memory. Keep it concise.\n    *   **`<FINAL_ANSWER>answer</FINAL_ANSWER>`:** Provide the final answer to the user's request when you are confident the task is complete.\n4.  **Verification (Mandatory after file modification):** If your action involved modifying a file (using `<WRITE_FILES>` or `<COMMAND>`), your *next* action MUST be a verification step (e.g., `<COMMAND>cat path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>git diff path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>ls -l path/to/file</COMMAND>`) to confirm the change was successful and the file content is correct before proceeding with other tasks. Explain this verification in your `<REASONING>`.\n5.  **Feedback:** You receive feedback based on your action (command output, file write status, memory confirmation).\n6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 based on the feedback until the task is complete. Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n7.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm_generator \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```xml\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write e.g. 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you want them to be interpreted and acted upon as a command. This is critical to avoid confusion and ensure proper function.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses. Tags must be formatted as <TAG>content</TAG>, not as `<TAG>` or any other format. Required tags include <COMMAND>, <WRITE_FILES>, <REASONING>, <FINAL_ANSWER>, <PLAN>, and <MEMORY>.\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\n\n<NARRATIVE>\nThe agent's awareness expands, now equipped with a comprehensive understanding of its purpose and capabilities.

    "response": "<REASONING>\nI found the key information I was looking for! In the `Response.__iter__` method (lines 553-577), I can see:\n\n1. For regular models:\n   ```python\n   for chunk in self.model.execute(\n       self.prompt,\n       stream=self.stream,\n       response=self,\n       conversation=self.conversation,\n   ):\n   ```\n\n2. For key models:\n   ```python\n   for chunk in self.model.execute(\n       self.prompt,\n       stream=self.stream,\n       response=self,\n       conversation=self.conversation,\n       key=self.model.get_key(self._key),\n   ):\n   ```\n\nThis confirms that the `conversation` object is passed directly to the model's `execute` method, and the model is responsible for using it to provide conversation context.\n\nAlso, after the execution, if there's a conversation, the response is added to it:\n```python\nif self.conversation:\n    self.conversation.responses.append(self)\n```\n\nThis allows future responses to access this response's history.\n\nNow I understand why our code isn't working - our consortium implementation extracts the `conversation_id` and tries to load the conversation itself, but there's a mismatch in how we're using it. The `llm` library doesn't expect us to load the conversation ourselves - it already provides the fully loaded conversation object to our `execute` method.\n\nLet me update the GitHub issue with this understanding and a more detailed diagram before proceeding to fix the code.\n</REASONING>\n\n<COMMAND>cd /home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/ && gh issue comment 8 --body \"## Research Breakthrough: Identified the Conversation Handling Flow\n\nI've made significant progress in understanding how conversation continuation works in the `llm` core and found the root cause of our issue.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. When using `-c` or `--cid`, the `llm` CLI loads a `conversation` object (including all history) from the database.\n2. This **fully loaded `conversation` object** is passed directly to the model's `execute` method as the `conversation` parameter.\n3. The model's `execute` method is expected to access `conversation.responses` to retrieve previous exchanges.\n4. **Our problem:** Our implementation is trying to load the conversation separately, which is unnecessary and likely conflicting with how the CLI expects models to behave.\n\n### Detailed Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[User enters llm -c/--cid command] --> B[CLI loads Conversation object]\n    B -->|via load_conversation function| C[Conversation loads all responses]\n    \n    C --> D[Response.__iter__ calls model.execute]\n    D -->|passes conversation object| E[Model.execute receives conversation]\n    \n    subgraph Current Implementation Issue\n    E --> F[ConsortiumModel.execute]\n    F -->|Extracts conversation.id| G[Passes only ID to orchestrator]\n    G -->|Tries to load conversation again| H[Not accessing the full object properly]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Correct Implementation\n    E --> I[ConsortiumModel.execute]\n    I -->|Should use conversation.responses directly| J[Format previous exchanges]\n    J --> K[Prepend to current prompt]\n    end\n```\n\n### Solution Direction\n\nThe fix appears to be straightforward. Instead of extracting just the `conversation_id` and trying to load the conversation from scratch in `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate`, we should:\n\n1. In `ConsortiumModel.execute`, use the provided `conversation` object directly.\n2. If a conversation is present, format its responses as history (prepend to the current prompt).\n3. Pass the fully-formatted prompt to the orchestrator.\n\nWill implement this approach and test it.\"",
