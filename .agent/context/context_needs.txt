Use shelllm gh account. Only listen for gh issue comments and messages from 'irthomasthomas'. So, you will read from irthomasthomas and work as shelllm. You can read all issues, as long as you only set github_monitor to monitor comments coming from irthomasthomas. To begin, read ALL of the information previously recorded in issue 10.
