Explicitly specify the repository (`--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`).\n    *   Second, construct and execute the command to run `/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/monitor_issue.sh` with the correct parameters (`--mode issue-comments`, `--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`, `--issue 10`, `--user irthomasthomas`).\n    *   Run the `monitor_issue.sh` script in the background (using `&`) so you can report its initiation and await further user instructions.\n    *   Structure your response using the required `<REASONING>`, `<PLAN>`, and `<COMMAND>` tags.\n    *   After initiating the background monitor, provide a confirmation message indicating that monitoring for comments by `irthomasthomas` on issue #10 has started.\n  </instructions>\n\n  <expected_output>\n    1.  Reasoning and plan for fetching issue data.\n    2.  Execution of the `gh issue view` command.\n    3.  Reasoning and plan for initiating the monitor.\n    4.  Execution of the `monitor_issue.sh` command in the background.\n    5.  A final confirmation that the data was retrieved (implicitly by showing the command output) and monitoring has begun. Do not use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` yet; await further instructions after starting the monitor.\n  </expected_output>\n</request>\n```"
