        <constraint>Use GitHub account associated with 'shelllm'.</constraint>
        <constraint>Monitor GitHub Issue #10 specifically.</constraint>
        <constraint>Only react to new comments on Issue #10 authored by the user 'irthomasthomas'.</constraint>
    </user_constraints>
  </context>

  <objective>
    1. Retrieve the complete content (including all previous comments) of GitHub Issue #10 from the repository `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`.
    2. After retrieving the content, initiate a background monitoring process using the `monitor_issue.sh` script to specifically watch **only** Issue #10 in the `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium` repository for **new comments** authored solely by the GitHub user `irthomasthomas`.
  </objective>

  <instructions>
    *   Ensure all GitHub operations (`gh` command, `monitor_issue.sh` script) are performed assuming the context of the `shelllm` GitHub account configuration.
    *   First, use the `gh` command to view Issue #10 along with all its comments. Explicitly specify the repository (`--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`).
    *   Second, construct and execute the command to run `/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/monitor_issue.sh` with the correct parameters (`--mode issue-comments`, `--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`, `--issue 10`, `--user irthomasthomas`).
    *   Run the `monitor_issue.sh` script in the background (using `&`) so you can report its initiation and await further user instructions.
    *   Structure your response using the required `<REASONING>`, `<PLAN>`, and `<COMMAND>` tags.
    *   After initiating the background monitor, provide a confirmation message indicating that monitoring for comments by `irthomasthomas` on issue #10 has started.
  </instructions>

  <expected_output>
    1.  Reasoning and plan for fetching issue data.
    2.  Execution of the `gh issue view` command.
    3.  Reasoning and plan for initiating the monitor.
    4.  Execution of the `monitor_issue.sh` command in the background.
    5.  A final confirmation that the data was retrieved (implicitly by showing the command output) and monitoring has begun. Do not use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` yet; await further instructions after starting the monitor.
