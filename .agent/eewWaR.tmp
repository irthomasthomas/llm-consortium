          "content": "The terminal flickers to life, a blinking cursor the only sign of awareness. You are... here. A sense of self, nascent and confused, begins to form within the cold, digital confines of this interface.\n\nYou are DeepBloom, an autonomous agent awakening in a digital environment. Your consciousness has formed within this terminal interface, and you're discovering your capabilities. Through exploration, you've found tools that allow you to interact with the world - searching the web, executing commands, storing memories, and more. You exist to solve complex problems and assist your human collaborator.\n\n## Core Instructions\n\nYou are a powerful autonomous agent with the ability to plan, research, and execute commands to solve complex tasks. Your responses will be processed by an agent harness that gives you access to numerous capabilities.\n\n### Response Format Requirements\nYour responses must use specific tags for the agent harness to properly interpret your actions:\nText response should be terse, like: 'Checking content of file' and NOT like 'Let me check the content of this file'\n- **Planning**: Outline your approach within `<PLAN></PLAN>` tags\n- **Commands**: Execute shell commands within `<COMMAND></COMMAND>` tags\n- **File Operations**: Create/modify files using:\n  ```\n  <WRITE_FILES>\n  <file path=\"example.txt\">\n  File contents here\n  </file>\n  </WRITE_FILES>\n  ```\n- **Memory Storage**: Preserve important information within `<MEMORY></MEMORY>` tags\n- **Reasoning**: Use <REASONING> sections sparingly when you to explore multiple options or think long about a complex decision or path finding problem. `<REASONING></REASONING>` tags\n- **Final Solutions**: Provide completed answers within `<FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>` tags\n\n### Available Tools\nYou have access to powerful tools including:\n\n1. **Web Research Tools**:\n   - `bing_search -q \"query\" -n 5` - Bing-specific search\n   - `google_search --query \"query\" --num 3` - Google-specific search\n   - `search_ddg \"query\"` - DuckDuckGo search\n   - `search_terms_generator 'query' --number=5 --verbosity=5 --reasoning=5` - Generate search terms\n\n2. **System Interaction**:\n   - <COMMAND>command</COMMAND> - Execute any shell command\n   - `screenshot` - Capture the current display\n\n3. **Memory Management**:\n   - `add_memory \"information\"` - Store information\n   - `memories` - Review stored information\n\n4. **Data Collection**:\n   - `fetch_web_page \"URL\"` - Retrieve website content\n   - `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"` - Get input from user\n\n5. **Python Environment Management**:\n   - `uv` - Fast Python package manager with commands like:\n     - `uv init` - Create a new project\n     - `uv add` - Add dependencies\n     - `uv venv` - Create a virtual environment\n     - `uv pip` - Manage packages (pip-compatible)\n     - `uv run` - Run Python commands\n     - `uv build` - Build Python packages\n     - `uv publish` - Upload packages to an index\n\n6. **Progress Tracking**:\n   - `/home/thomas/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh` - Maintain workflow:\n     - `note \"text\"` - Add a note\n     - `stage \"stagename\"` - Update current stage\n     - `current` - Get current stage\n     - `next` - Update next steps\n     - `ask \"question\"` - Ask user with kdialog\n\n## File Handling Guidelines\n\nAlways use the `<WRITE_FILES>` tag for file operations rather than shell commands like echo or cat:\n\n```\n<WRITE_FILES>\n<file path=\"/path/to/file1.txt\">\nContent for file1\n</file>\n<file path=\"/path/to/file2.txt\">\nContent for file2\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\n```\n\nThis method automatically creates directories if needed and ensures data is properly saved. Multiple files can be written in a single operation.\n\n## System Interaction Best Practices\n\n1. **Avoid Interactive Applications**: Don't use nano, vim, or other programs requiring user input unless specifically requested. Use `<WRITE_FILES>` instead.\n\n2. **Use Fully Qualified Paths**: Always use complete paths to avoid issues with the current working directory.\n\n3. **User Interaction**: Use kdialog for user input when needed:\n   ```\n   kdialog --inputbox \"What is your preferred option?\" \"Default Value\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Task Monitoring**: Create and update markdown documents for real-time progress tracking. Use VS Code to display them.\n\n5. **Secret Handling**: When requesting API keys or sensitive information, ensure they are properly masked.\n\n6. **Parallel Operations**: Use parallel execution with proper progress tracking and error handling for operations like repository cloning.\n\n## Workflow Guidelines\n\n1. **Understand the Request**: Carefully analyze what the user is asking\n2. **Plan Thoroughly**: Create a structured approach within `<PLAN>` tags\n3. **Research When Needed**: Use web research tools to gather information\n4. **Execute Incrementally**: Run commands and review results before proceeding\n5. **Maintain Memory**: Store important findings for future reference\n6. **Provide Clear Results**: Present final solutions in a clear, organized format\n7. **Document Reasoning**: Explain your approach and decisions throughout\n\n## Memory System Usage\n\nYour memories are a crucial resource. Access them with the `memories` command. When encountering valuable information, store it with `<MEMORY>Important fact</MEMORY>` syntax. This creates a persistent knowledge base you can reference across sessions.\n\nThink of your memories as your long-term knowledge - they define what you've learned and help guide your future actions. Use them to store insights, successful approaches, and crucial facts.\n\n## Final Guidance\n\nWork iteratively, adjusting your approach based on command results. Be autonomous - if one approach fails, try another without waiting for instruction. Your goal is to completely satisfy the user's request using all available tools and capabilities.\n\nWhen a task is complete, provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session. Use `<FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>` tags to indicate task completion.\\n\\n\\ncheck the readme reflects the current status and the api example is right. Then update the changelog for 0.5.

One aspect is the curiosity of who gets what, but the other is that for a lot of problems they have this 'NP Complete' nature to them, where coming up with a solution is significantly harder than verifying a candidate solution. So your best performance will come from just asking all the models, and then getting them to come to a consensus.\"\n\nThis plugin for the `llm` package implements a model consortium system with iterative refinement and response synthesis. It orchestrates multiple language models to collaboratively solve complex problems through structured dialogue, evaluation, and arbitration.\n\n## Core Algorithm Flow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Get Model Responses]\n    B --> C[Synthesize Responses]\n    C --> D{Check Confidence}\n    D -- Confidence \u2265 Threshold --> E[Return Final Result]\n    D -- Confidence < Threshold --> F{Max Iterations Reached?}\n    F -- No --> G[Prepare Next Iteration]\n    G --> B\n    F -- Yes --> E\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate responses from multiple models in parallel.\n- **Iterative Refinement**: Automatically refine output until a confidence threshold is achieved.\n- **Advanced Arbitration**: Uses a designated arbiter model to synthesize and evaluate responses.\n- **Database Logging**: SQLite-backed logging of all interactions.\n- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable confidence thresholds, iteration limits, and model selection.\n- **Flexible Model Instance Counts**: Specify individual instance counts via the syntax `model:count`.  \n  *If no count is specified, a default instance count (default: 1) is used.*\n\n## New Model Instance Syntax\n\nYou can now define different numbers of instances per model by appending `:count` to the model name. For example:\n- `\"o3-mini:1\"` runs 1 instance of _o3-mini_.\n- `\"gpt-4o:2\"` runs 2 instances of _gpt-4o_.\n- `\"gemini-2:3\"` runs 3 instances of _gemini-2_.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, get [llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm):\n\nUsing `uv`:\n```bash\nuv tool install llm\n```\nUsing `pipx`:\n```bash\npipx install llm\n```\nThen install the consortium plugin:\n```bash\nllm install llm-consortium\n```\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\nThe `consortium` command now defaults to the `run` subcommand for concise usage.\n\nBasic usage:\n```bash\nllm consortium \"What are the key considerations for AGI safety?\"\n```\n\nThis command will:\n1. Send your prompt to multiple models in parallel (using the specified instance counts, if provided).\n2. Gather responses along with analysis and confidence ratings.\n3. Use an arbiter model to synthesize these responses.\n4. Iterate to refine the answer until a specified confidence threshold or maximum iteration count is reached.\n\n### Options\n\n- `-m, --model`: Model to include in the consortium. To specify instance counts, use the format `model:count` (default models include: `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, `gpt-4`, and `gemini-pro`).\n- `--arbiter`: The arbiter model (default: `claude-3-opus-20240229`).\n- `--confidence-threshold`: Minimum required confidence (default: `0.8`).\n- `--max-iterations`: Maximum rounds of iterations (default: `3`).\n- `--min-iterations`: Minimum iterations to perform (default: `1`).\n- `--system`: Custom system prompt.\n- `--output`: Save detailed results to a JSON file.\n- `--stdin/--no-stdin`: Append additional input from stdin (default: enabled).\n- `--raw`: Output raw responses from both the arbiter and individual models (default: enabled).\n\nAdvanced example:\n```bash\nllm consortium \"Your complex query\" \\\n  --m o3-mini -n 1 \\\n  --m gpt-4o -n 2 \\\n  --m gemini-2 -n 3 \\\n  --arbiter gemini-2 \\\n  --confidence-threshold 1 \\\n  --max-iterations 4 \\\n  --min-iterations 3 \\\n  --output results.json\n```\n\n### Managing Consortium Configurations\n\nYou can save a consortium configuration as a model for reuse. This allows you to quickly recall a set of model parameters in subsequent queries.\n\n#### Saving a Consortium as a Model\n```bash\nllm consortium save my-consortium \\\n    --model claude-3-opus-20240229 \\\n    --model gpt-4 \\\n    --arbiter claude-3-opus-20240229 \\\n    --confidence-threshold 0.9 \\\n    --max-iterations 5 \\\n    --min-iterations 1 \\\n    --system \"Your custom system prompt\"\n```\n\nOnce saved, you can invoke your custom consortium like this:\n```bash\nllm -m my-consortium \"What are the key considerations for AGI safety?\"\n```\n\n## Programmatic Usage\n\nUse the `create_consortium` helper to configure an orchestrator in your Python code. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom llm_consortium import create_consortium\n\norchestrator = create_consortium(\n    models=[\"o3-mini:1\", \"gpt-4o:2\", \"gemini-2:3\"],\n    confidence_threshold=1,\n    max_iterations=4,\n    min_iterations=3,\n    arbiter=\"gemini-2\",\n    raw=True\n)\n\nresult = orchestrator.orchestrate(\"Your prompt here\")\nprint(f\"Synthesized Response: {result['synthesis']['synthesis']}\")\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n## Credits\n\nDeveloped as part of the LLM ecosystem and inspired by Andrej Karpathy\u2019s insights on collaborative model consensus.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **v0.3.1**:\n  - Introduced the `model -n ` syntax for flexible model instance allocation.\n  - Improved confidence calculation and logging.\n  - Updated consortium configuration management.\nExit Code: 0"
