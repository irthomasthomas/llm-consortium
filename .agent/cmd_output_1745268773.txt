== Query for SUPER_USER: Clarify Sub-Agent Spawning ==
==================================================

Received instruction to spawn a sub-agent to monitor for new issues using a command like '$agent "instructions..." -m=ALTERNATE'.

1.  How do I request spawning a sub-agent? Is there a specific tag like "<SPAWN_AGENT>" or another command I should use?
2.  What LLM model does '-m=ALTERNATE' correspond to?
3.  Should the 'careful instructions' for the sub-agent include the full command like: `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --user irthomasthomas`?

Please clarify these points.
