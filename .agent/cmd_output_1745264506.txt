Next, I want you to use a different needle/keyword for each run for each independent test.
Then run the same tests again.
Verify the results.
Read the logs for each test and double check everything.

Post the experiment results. Summarise the log results. And include the raw logs (just the most relevant fields - exclude json fields and etc).

Note: Just add the above to the tasks list for the next agent to do.

One more thing: I don't like the dialog boxes anymore. They are too small and hard to read. Can you code up, very quickly, a better solution. The dialog input boxes are currently used to get the immediate attention of and communicate with  SUPER_USER. Normally for quick clarifying questions or resolving immediate environment issues. Normal project comms will still be handled via gh issues.

Ensure both unit and integration tests are up to date and passing.
