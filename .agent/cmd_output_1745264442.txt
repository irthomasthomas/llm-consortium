**Ref:** Previous Handoff: [https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-consortium/issues/8#issuecomment-2819243279](https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-consortium/issues/8#issuecomment-2819243279)

**Current Status:**
*   Conversation continuation feature implemented and basic tests passed.
*   `ask_superuser.sh` script created as a replacement for `kdialog`.

**ADDED TASKS for Next Agent Session:**

1.  **Enhanced Keyword Memory Testing:**
    *   Perform the keyword memory test (like the 'HONEYBADGER' test) again for **both** `4.1-n1` and `qwq-consortium`.
    *   Use a **new, unique keyword** for each test run (e.g., 'PLATYPUS', 'ECHIDNA'). Do *not* reuse keywords.
    *   Immediately after each initial prompt, capture the `conversation_id` (e.g., `test_cid=$(llm logs list -n 1 --json | jq -r '.[].conversation_id')`).
    *   Use the captured ID for the follow-up prompt (`llm -c --cid $test_cid \"What word...\"`).
    *   **Verify Logs:** After *each* successful test run (both initial and follow-up), run `llm logs -n 3` (or more if needed) and confirm the expected 3 log entries are present (member model, arbiter model, final synthesized log with consortium name as model).
    *   **Report Results:** Create a *new* GitHub comment summarizing the test outcomes (pass/fail for recall) and the log verification results for each consortium and keyword. Include relevant log fields (e.g., `id`, `model`, `prompt`, `response`, `conversation_id`, `datetime_utc` - *exclude* large JSON fields for brevity) for the 3 key log entries per run.

2.  **Robust Synthesis Logging:** (Task defined in previous handoff) Implement the logic to ensure the final synthesized log entry's `response` field contains clean synthesis text or fallback raw arbiter text, and the `prompt` field contains only the original user prompt.

3.  **Update General Tests:**
    *   Locate existing unit/integration tests (e.g., in `tests/`).
    *   Add specific tests covering the conversation continuation functionality.
    *   Ensure all tests (new and existing) pass.

**UPDATED Interaction Instructions:**

*   **GitHub Issues:** Use for standard project communication, updates, and reporting results.

*   **`monitor_issue.sh`:** Use this script after completing a task or posting a significant update to GitHub to wait for new instructions from `irthomasthomas`.
    ```bash
    /home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/monitor_issue.sh
    ```

Refactor it to be more generic and useful.

Allow monitoring:
 - any gh issue thread for new comments by owner
 - New issues belonging to a specified repo
 - Optionally specify a label which must also be present for the script to return the content

I want this to support spawning sub-agents from the main thread which will then monitor a different repo or issue thread for different projects and tasks.

Ask me if anything is unclear...
When you have refactored it, you should be able to launch it in such a way that it resumes monitoring this gh issue thread.
Note also that the default values you wrote last time where too tight, like, don't put such a small limit on issue_count, allow for at least 100...

Next, I want you to use a different needle/keyword for each run for each independent test.
Then run the same tests again.
Verify the results.
Read the logs for each test and double check everything.

Post the experiment results. Summarise the log results. And include the raw logs (just the most relevant fields - exclude json fields and etc).

Note: Just add the above to the tasks list for the next agent to do.

One more thing: I don't like the dialog boxes anymore. They are too small and hard to read. Can you code up, very quickly, a better solution. The dialog input boxes are currently used to get the immediate attention of and communicate with  SUPER_USER. Normally for quick clarifying questions or resolving immediate environment issues. Normal project comms will still be handled via gh issues.

Ensure both unit and integration tests are up to date and passing.
