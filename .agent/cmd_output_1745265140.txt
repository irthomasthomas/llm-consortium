== Query for SUPER_USER: Clarify Monitoring Request ==
==================================================

I understand you want me to monitor the llm-consortium repo for comments by irthomasthomas. My refactored monitor_issue.sh script can monitor *comments on a specific issue* (like \#8) or *new issues* in the repo. It doesn`t currently support monitoring *all comments across all issues simultaneously*.

Which type of monitoring do you intend for the next instructions?
a) Monitor issue \#8 comments (defaulting to the current instruction thread)?
b) Monitor for *new issues* created by irthomasthomas in this repo?
c) A new, more complex 'monitor all comments in repo' mode is required?
(Reply with 'a', 'b', or 'c' or provide clarification)
