Stdout/Stderr: - [] Save consortium prompts to a seperate table in llm logs db than the rest of the logs.
- [] The final prompt which uses the consortium name for the model should continue to be saved in the llm logs table.
- [] Extract evals from consortium responses. Figure out a way reliably find old consortium prompts in the logs and label or organize them.
- [] We can get the list of consortium model names and search the logs for them. 
- [] For iteration, I am considering changing the approach to take advantage of conversation prompt caching in models which support it. I think it might be best to record the conversation_id for each instance, and then reply to that conversation id with feedback. This way we would not need to explicitly construct iteration history as it would be handled by the llm python library. What do you think? Pros and cons etc?
