<REASONING>
Thank you for providing the diff. It seems the changes are primarily related to newline characters (`\n\n` being replaced with `\n` in string joins and print statements). These appear to be formatting adjustments, possibly introduced automatically, and don't seem to affect the core fallback logic added in the last commit.

Since these changes are unrelated to the functionality we need to test (the logging fallback), and to avoid any potential side effects, I recommend discarding these uncommitted changes to revert `llm_consortium/__init__.py` back to the exact state of the last commit (`4d1450c`). I should also restore the related build files to match the clean state.

Do you agree? If so, I will run the necessary `git restore` commands.

<PLAN>
1.  Await user confirmation to discard the uncommitted formatting changes.
2.  If confirmed, execute `git restore llm_consortium/__init__.py` and `git restore build/lib/llm_consortium/__init__.py llm_consortium.egg-info/PKG-INFO llm_consortium/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc` to clean the working directory of tracked files. I will ignore the untracked files for now.
3.  Verify the working directory is clean using `git status`.
4.  Proceed with verifying the content of `llm_consortium/__init__.py` and `TODO.md`.
</PLAN>
<FINAL_ANSWER>Problem Report: Uncommitted formatting changes detected in `llm_consortium/__init__.py` and related build files after `git status`. The changes appear to be newline character adjustments. Proposed solution is to discard these changes using `git restore` to ensure testing is performed on the exact state of the last commit (`4d1450c`). Awaiting confirmation before proceeding.</FINAL_ANSWER>
