# Copilot in VS Code - Learning Diary

## Goals
- Learn to use GitHub Copilot in VS Code to work on the TODO list
- Practice using different Copilot features (Chat and Edit)
- Document successes and challenges

## Current TODO Items
1. ✅ Organize the codebase and move examples to a separate directory
2. ✅ Improve database logging - generate a unique consortium_id, like conversation_id for each query
3. ✅ Improve the display of the results in the console
4. ✅ Add option to control the display of intermediary arbiter results

## Progress

### 2024-03-10: Working with Copilot Edit

1. **Successfully activated Copilot Chat and Edit panels**:
   - Used Ctrl+Alt+I to activate Copilot Chat
   - Used Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I to activate Copilot Edit
   - Observed slash commands available in Chat mode

2. **Asked Copilot about implementing consortium_id**:
   - Provided context about the needed changes from consortium_implementation.py
   - Copilot generated suggestions for implementing UUID import and modifying the orchestrate method

3. **Implemented consortium_id changes**:
   - Added UUID import to the top of the file
   - Modified orchestrate method to generate and use consortium_id
   - Updated _get_model_responses, _get_model_response, and _synthesize_responses to accept and use consortium_id
   - Updated log_response function to accept consortium_id and add it to response data
   - Added ensure_consortium_id_column function to handle database schema updates
   - Called ensure_consortium_id_column during initialization

4. **Improved console output display**:
   - Added colorama for colored terminal output
   - Enhanced the run_command function to display results with better formatting
   - Added headers, colors, and included consortium_id in the output
   - Updated requirements.txt to include colorama

5. **Added option to control intermediary results display**:
   - Added a new --show-intermediary/--hide-intermediary option to the run command
   - Updated the run_command function to accept the new parameter
   - Implemented the display of intermediary results when enabled
   - Added appropriate formatting and colors for intermediary results

6. **Observations on Copilot Edit**:
   - Very helpful for making targeted changes across multiple functions
   - Accurately understood the context and suggested appropriate modifications
   - Using Ctrl+Enter allows accepting changes while Ctrl+S saves the file
   - Need to wait sufficient time for Copilot to generate suggestions (20+ seconds)

7. **Successes**:
   - Completed all items from the TODO list
   - Successfully used both Copilot Chat and Edit features
   - Implemented complex changes across multiple functions with Copilot's help
   - Maintained code consistency and style

8. **Challenges**:
   - Initial navigation and command execution was challenging
   - Needed to wait longer than expected for Copilot to generate suggestions
   - Had to be careful with accepting changes to avoid introducing bugs

9. **Tips for working with Copilot**:
   - Be specific in your prompts to get precise suggestions
   - Provide context about the codebase when asking for help
   - Wait at least 20 seconds for Copilot to generate comprehensive suggestions
   - Review suggestions carefully before accepting them
   - Use Ctrl+Enter to accept changes in Copilot Edit
