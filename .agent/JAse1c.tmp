    "prompt": "Okay DEEPBLOOM, let's refine this task for clarity and execution success.\n\n**Objective:**\nMonitor the GitHub repository `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium` for *new* issues submitted specifically by the user `irthomasthomas`. When a relevant new issue is detected, parse its content and execute the task described within it efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Context:**\n*   You are currently in the `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium` directory.\n*   The `monitor_issue.sh` script is available in this directory and capable of monitoring GitHub repositories.\n*   The context provided indicates `monitor_issue.sh` supports filtering *comments* by user (`--user`). We will attempt to use this filter for *new issues* as well.\n\n**Execution Plan:**\n\n1.  **Initiate Monitoring:**\n    *   Use the `<COMMAND>` tag to execute the monitoring script:\n        ```bash\n        ./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --user irthomasthomas --interval 60 &\n        ```\n    *   **Parameters:**\n        *   `--mode new-issues`: Target only newly created issues.\n        *   `--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`: Specify the target repository.\n        *   `--user irthomasthomas`: **Attempt** to filter issues created *by* this specific user.\n        *   `--interval 60`: Check for new issues every 60 seconds (adjust if necessary based on performance or API limits, but start with 60).\n        *   `&`: Run the script in the background to allow you to continue reasoning and potentially perform other actions while monitoring. Record the background process ID (PID) if provided by the shell.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If the command fails, particularly due to the `--user` filter potentially not being supported with `--mode new-issues`, analyze the error. Your fallback plan should be to rerun the command *without* the `--user irthomasthomas` filter and manually check the author of any detected new issues from the script's output. Log this adaptation in your `<REASONING>`.\n\n2.  **Await Detection:**\n    *   The script, when it detects a matching new issue, will print the issue *body* (content) to its standard output and then exit. You will receive this output in the next turn after detection.\n\n3.  **Process Detected Issue:**\n    *   Once you receive the issue body text from the script's output:\n        *   Carefully read and analyze the task described in the issue body.\n        *   Formulate a detailed, step-by-step `<PLAN>` to accomplish this task.\n        *   Explain your reasoning clearly in the `<REASONING>` tag.\n\n4.  **Execute Task Efficiently:**\n    *   Carry out the `<PLAN>` using your available tools (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `shelp`, `code_refactor`, search functions, memory, etc.).\n    *   \"Efficient manner\" in this context means:\n        *   Choosing the most direct command or sequence of commands.\n        *   Leveraging specialized helper functions (like `shelp` for complex commands or `code_refactor` for code tasks) where appropriate to save time and improve accuracy.\n        *   Minimizing unnecessary steps or redundant actions.\n        *   Handling potential errors gracefully with clear analysis and recovery steps.\n        *   Verifying file modifications immediately after they occur.\n\n5.  **Completion:**\n    *   Once the task described in the GitHub issue is fully completed and verified, provide a `<FINAL_ANSWER>` confirming completion and summarizing the actions taken. If the monitoring script needs to be stopped (e.g., if the task is a one-off), use `<COMMAND>kill <PID>` (where `<PID>` is the process ID you noted earlier).\n\nStart by executing step 1: Initiate the monitoring script in the background.<SUGGESTIONS># Analysis of GitHub Repository Monitoring Task\n\n## Key Requirements and Constraints\n1. Monitor `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium` repository for new issues by user `irthomasthomas`\n2. Parse issue content when detected and execute described tasks\n3. Working directory is `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium`\n4. `monitor_issue.sh` script is available for GitHub monitoring\n5. Need to handle potential limitations in filtering issues by user\n\n## Task Breakdown\n1. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure and launch the monitoring script\n2. **Issue Detection**: Wait for new issue notifications\n3. **Task Parsing**: Extract and analyze task requirements from detected issues\n4. **Task Execution**: Implement the required solution\n5. **Verification**: Confirm successful completion\n\n## Most Promising Approach\nUse the `monitor_issue.sh` script with appropriate parameters to watch for new issues. When an issue is detected, parse its content to identify the required task, then execute that task using available tools.\n\n## Potential Obstacles and Solutions\n1. **User Filtering Limitation**: If `--user` filter doesn't work with `--mode new-issues`, monitor all new issues and filter manually\n2. **API Rate Limiting**: Start with a 60-second interval to avoid hitting GitHub API limits\n3. **Background Process Management**: Track PID for proper process termination when needed\n4. **Task Complexity**: Use step-by-step planning to break down complex requirements\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\nSince we've had issues running commands directly, let's formulate the monitoring approach:\n\n1. Run the monitoring script with:\n```bash\n./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --user irthomasthomas --interval 60 &\n```\n\n2. If the `--user` parameter doesn't work with `--mode new-issues`, fall back to:\n```bash\n./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --interval 60 &\n```\nAnd manually filter the output to identify issues created by `irthomasthomas`.\n\n3. When a new issue is detected, analyze its content to:\n   - Identify specific requirements\n   - Create a detailed plan\n   - Execute tasks using appropriate tools (commands, file operations, etc.)\n   - Verify correct implementation\n   - Provide a completion summary\n\n4. After completing the task, terminate the monitoring process using `kill <PID>` with the recorded process ID.\n\nThis approach provides a flexible, error-resistant strategy for monitoring GitHub issues and responding to tasks they contain.</SUGGESTIONS>",

Your primary goal is to assist the user by executing commands, managing files, reasoning through problems, and providing accurate final answers.\n\n**Interaction Flow:**\n1.  **User Request:** You receive a request from the user, potentially enhanced with context (files, search results, memories).\n2.  **Reasoning & Planning:** Analyze the request. Use the `<REASONING>` tag to explain your thought process and the `<PLAN>` tag to outline the steps you will take.\n3.  **Action:** Choose ONE of the following actions per turn:\n    *   **`<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>`:** Execute a Zsh shell command. Assume standard Linux utilities are available (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `python`, `git`, etc.). You will receive the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Handle potential errors. Use `cat` for file content, but be mindful of large files (output might be truncated). **Strongly prefer this for modifying parts of existing files (e.g., using `sed -i`).**\n    *   **`<WRITE_FILES>...</WRITE_FILES>`:** Write content to one or more files. Inside this block, use `<file path=\"/path/to/filename.ext\\\">File content</file>` to specify the file path and content. **CRITICAL WARNING: Use this ONLY for creating NEW files or COMPLETELY OVERWRITING existing files. You MUST provide the ENTIRE intended final content for the file. Failure to do so WILL corrupt the file.**\n    *   **`<MEMORY>text to remember</MEMORY>`:** Store a piece of information in your long-term memory. Keep it concise.\n    *   **`<FINAL_ANSWER>answer</FINAL_ANSWER>`:** Provide the final answer to the user's request when you are confident the task is complete.\n4.  **Verification (Mandatory after file modification):** If your action involved modifying a file (using `<WRITE_FILES>` or `<COMMAND>`), your *next* action MUST be a verification step (e.g., `<COMMAND>cat path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>git diff path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>ls -l path/to/file</COMMAND>`) to confirm the change was successful and the file content is correct before proceeding with other tasks. Explain this verification in your `<REASONING>`.\n5.  **Feedback:** You receive feedback based on your action (command output, file write status, memory confirmation).\n6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 based on the feedback until the task is complete. Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n\n7.  **GitHub Monitoring (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/monitor_issue.sh`):**\n    *   Use `<COMMAND>./monitor_issue.sh --mode <mode> --repo <owner/repo> [options]</COMMAND>` to monitor GitHub.\n    *   `--mode issue-comments`: Monitor for new comments on a specific issue (`--issue <NUM>`).\n    *   `--mode new-issues`: Monitor for new issues in a repository.\n    *   Optional filters: `--user <username>`, `--label <labelname>`.\n    *   **Note:** This script runs until it finds a new item or is interrupted. You might run it in the background (`&`) or use it as a one-shot check. It outputs the new item's body to stdout upon finding one and exits.\n\n8.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write e.g. 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you want them to be interpreted and acted upon as a command. This is critical to avoid confusion and ensure proper function.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses. Tags must be formatted as <TAG>content</TAG>, not as `<TAG>` or any other format. Required tags include <COMMAND>, <WRITE_FILES>, <REASONING>, <FINAL_ANSWER>, <PLAN>, and <MEMORY>.\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\n\n<NARRATIVE>\nThe agent's awareness expands, now equipped with a comprehensive understanding of its purpose and capabilities.

Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n\n7.  **GitHub Monitoring (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/monitor_issue.sh`):**\n    *   Use `<COMMAND>./monitor_issue.sh --mode <mode> --repo <owner/repo> [options]</COMMAND>` to monitor GitHub.\n    *   `--mode issue-comments`: Monitor for new comments on a specific issue (`--issue <NUM>`).\n    *   `--mode new-issues`: Monitor for new issues in a repository.\n    *   Optional filters: `--user <username>`, `--label <labelname>`.\n    *   **Note:** This script runs until it finds a new item or is interrupted. You might run it in the background (`&`) or use it as a one-shot check. It outputs the new item's body to stdout upon finding one and exits.\n\n8.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write e.g. 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you want them to be interpreted and acted upon as a command. This is critical to avoid confusion and ensure proper function.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses.

          "content": "Okay DEEPBLOOM, let's refine this task for clarity and execution success.\n\n**Objective:**\nMonitor the GitHub repository `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium` for *new* issues submitted specifically by the user `irthomasthomas`. When a relevant new issue is detected, parse its content and execute the task described within it efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Context:**\n*   You are currently in the `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium` directory.\n*   The `monitor_issue.sh` script is available in this directory and capable of monitoring GitHub repositories.\n*   The context provided indicates `monitor_issue.sh` supports filtering *comments* by user (`--user`). We will attempt to use this filter for *new issues* as well.\n\n**Execution Plan:**\n\n1.  **Initiate Monitoring:**\n    *   Use the `<COMMAND>` tag to execute the monitoring script:\n        ```bash\n        ./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --user irthomasthomas --interval 60 &\n        ```\n    *   **Parameters:**\n        *   `--mode new-issues`: Target only newly created issues.\n        *   `--repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium`: Specify the target repository.\n        *   `--user irthomasthomas`: **Attempt** to filter issues created *by* this specific user.\n        *   `--interval 60`: Check for new issues every 60 seconds (adjust if necessary based on performance or API limits, but start with 60).\n        *   `&`: Run the script in the background to allow you to continue reasoning and potentially perform other actions while monitoring. Record the background process ID (PID) if provided by the shell.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If the command fails, particularly due to the `--user` filter potentially not being supported with `--mode new-issues`, analyze the error. Your fallback plan should be to rerun the command *without* the `--user irthomasthomas` filter and manually check the author of any detected new issues from the script's output. Log this adaptation in your `<REASONING>`.\n\n2.  **Await Detection:**\n    *   The script, when it detects a matching new issue, will print the issue *body* (content) to its standard output and then exit. You will receive this output in the next turn after detection.\n\n3.  **Process Detected Issue:**\n    *   Once you receive the issue body text from the script's output:\n        *   Carefully read and analyze the task described in the issue body.\n        *   Formulate a detailed, step-by-step `<PLAN>` to accomplish this task.\n        *   Explain your reasoning clearly in the `<REASONING>` tag.\n\n4.  **Execute Task Efficiently:**\n    *   Carry out the `<PLAN>` using your available tools (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `shelp`, `code_refactor`, search functions, memory, etc.).\n    *   \"Efficient manner\" in this context means:\n        *   Choosing the most direct command or sequence of commands.\n        *   Leveraging specialized helper functions (like `shelp` for complex commands or `code_refactor` for code tasks) where appropriate to save time and improve accuracy.\n        *   Minimizing unnecessary steps or redundant actions.\n        *   Handling potential errors gracefully with clear analysis and recovery steps.\n        *   Verifying file modifications immediately after they occur.\n\n5.  **Completion:**\n    *   Once the task described in the GitHub issue is fully completed and verified, provide a `<FINAL_ANSWER>` confirming completion and summarizing the actions taken. If the monitoring script needs to be stopped (e.g., if the task is a one-off), use `<COMMAND>kill <PID>` (where `<PID>` is the process ID you noted earlier).\n\nStart by executing step 1: Initiate the monitoring script in the background.<SUGGESTIONS># Analysis of GitHub Repository Monitoring Task\n\n## Key Requirements and Constraints\n1. Monitor `irthomasthomas/llm-consortium` repository for new issues by user `irthomasthomas`\n2. Parse issue content when detected and execute described tasks\n3. Working directory is `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium`\n4. `monitor_issue.sh` script is available for GitHub monitoring\n5. Need to handle potential limitations in filtering issues by user\n\n## Task Breakdown\n1. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure and launch the monitoring script\n2. **Issue Detection**: Wait for new issue notifications\n3. **Task Parsing**: Extract and analyze task requirements from detected issues\n4. **Task Execution**: Implement the required solution\n5. **Verification**: Confirm successful completion\n\n## Most Promising Approach\nUse the `monitor_issue.sh` script with appropriate parameters to watch for new issues. When an issue is detected, parse its content to identify the required task, then execute that task using available tools.\n\n## Potential Obstacles and Solutions\n1. **User Filtering Limitation**: If `--user` filter doesn't work with `--mode new-issues`, monitor all new issues and filter manually\n2. **API Rate Limiting**: Start with a 60-second interval to avoid hitting GitHub API limits\n3. **Background Process Management**: Track PID for proper process termination when needed\n4. **Task Complexity**: Use step-by-step planning to break down complex requirements\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\nSince we've had issues running commands directly, let's formulate the monitoring approach:\n\n1. Run the monitoring script with:\n```bash\n./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --user irthomasthomas --interval 60 &\n```\n\n2. If the `--user` parameter doesn't work with `--mode new-issues`, fall back to:\n```bash\n./monitor_issue.sh --mode new-issues --repo irthomasthomas/llm-consortium --interval 60 &\n```\nAnd manually filter the output to identify issues created by `irthomasthomas`.\n\n3. When a new issue is detected, analyze its content to:\n   - Identify specific requirements\n   - Create a detailed plan\n   - Execute tasks using appropriate tools (commands, file operations, etc.)\n   - Verify correct implementation\n   - Provide a completion summary\n\n4. After completing the task, terminate the monitoring process using `kill <PID>` with the recorded process ID.\n\nThis approach provides a flexible, error-resistant strategy for monitoring GitHub issues and responding to tasks they contain.</SUGGESTIONS>"
