## Conversation Continuation Feature: Testing Complete ✅

The 'HONEYBADGER' memory tests have been successfully completed for both specified simple consortia:

1.  **Test with `4.1-n1` consortium:**
    *   Initial prompt: Set 'HONEYBADGER'.
    *   Follow-up (`-c --cid ...`): Asked what word to remember.
    *   **Result:** Correctly responded 'HONEYBADGER'. **Pass.** ✅

2.  **Test with `qwq-consortium`:**
    *   Initial prompt: Set 'HONEYBADGER'.
    *   Follow-up (`-c --cid ...`): Asked what word to remember.
    *   **Result:** Correctly responded 'HONEYBADGER'. **Pass.** ✅
    *   *Note:* While the correct word was recalled, the synthesis reported low confidence and suggested iteration. This appears to be a characteristic of the `fast-qwq` model/arbiter in this setup, not a bug in the conversation continuation logic itself, as the context *was* successfully used.

**Conclusion:** The implemented changes correctly enable conversation continuation for the `llm-consortium` plugin using both `-c` and explicit `--cid` flags. The feature is working as intended.

Ready for the next task.
