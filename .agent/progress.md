# Project Organization Progress

## Initial Assessment
- Project appears to be a plugin for the LLM library that implements a model consortium system
- It orchestrates multiple language models to collaboratively solve problems
- Key files are in the `llm_consortium` directory
- There are some development files (like consortium_id_changes.txt and consortium_implementation.py) that should be moved
- Tests exist but may need enhancement

## Files to Move to .agent Directory
- [x] consortium_id_changes.txt - Implementation notes for consortium_id feature
- [x] consortium_implementation.py - Code snippets for implementation
- [x] copilot_diary.md - Development notes
- [x] naming-things.png - Image file, likely for documentation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Run initial project assessment with llm cartographer
- [x] Move non-essential files to .agent directory
- [x] Create a comprehensive test plan
- [x] Create contributing guidelines
- [x] Start implementing enhanced tests
  - [x] Tests for file reader functions
  - [x] Tests for model parsing functionality
  - [x] Tests for confidence parsing
  - [x] Tests for arbiter response parsing
- [x] Create a test running script with coverage reporting
- [x] Create consortium test plan document
- [x] Create script for testing consortium with different model configurations

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Continue enhancing the test suite
  - [ ] Execute the created tests and fix any issues
  - [ ] Test CLI functionality comprehensively
  - [ ] Add integration tests with mocked models
  - [ ] Create tests for the consortium with real models (need to ask for model list)
- [ ] Organize project structure
  - [ ] Review module organization
  - [ ] Ensure proper documentation in all modules
- [ ] Improve documentation
  - [ ] Ensure README is up-to-date
  - [ ] Add developer guide
  - [ ] Add examples with explanations

## Next Steps
1. Execute the tests we've created to see if they pass with the current codebase
2. Ask for a list of models to use for testing the consortium functionality
3. Implement more CLI tests
4. Add a development guide with setup instructions
5. Create a demonstration notebook or script to showcase the library's capabilities

## Accomplishments Today
- Organized project by moving non-essential files to .agent directory
- Created comprehensive test plan and contributing guidelines
- Implemented multiple test files for various components
- Created a test running script with coverage reporting
- Developed a specialized test script for consortium model testing
- Created consortium test plan for testing with real models
