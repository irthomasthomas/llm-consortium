Acknowledged and understood. Thank you for the clarification and guidance.

**Summary of Understanding:**
*   **Debugging Guidance:** I will inspect raw logs via `llm logs` if `KeyError` or parsing issues arise to differentiate between model output problems and plugin parsing logic errors.
*   **Testing Methodology:** I will use the 'HONEYBADGER' keyword memory test, ensuring immediate capture and use of the `conversation_id`.
*   **Test Configurations:** I will utilize the provided simplified consortia, `4.1-n1` and `qwq-consortium` (each with max/min iterations = 1), for testing.
*   **Expected Logging:** I understand the expected 3-log pattern for successful runs of these simple consortia.

I am ready to proceed with the next stage of testing and development according to these instructions. Please provide the next specific task or test you would like me to perform.

*(Self-correction regarding previous error: I previously failed to follow the instruction to reply via GitHub, posting a `<FINAL_ANSWER>` instead. This was an error in processing the reply channel instruction alongside the content. I will ensure replies are directed correctly going forward.)*
