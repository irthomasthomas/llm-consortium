# Consortium Testing Plan

## Purpose
To develop comprehensive tests for the LLM Consortium functionality with real models to ensure it works correctly in real-world scenarios.

## Testing Approaches

### 1. Unit Testing with Mocks
- Test the orchestration logic without actual model calls
- Verify proper handling of model responses
- Test confidence calculation and iteration logic
- Test error handling for model failures

### 2. Integration Testing with Real Models
- Test end-to-end functionality with actual LLM models
- Verify proper synthesis across different models
- Test with various prompts to ensure robust operation
- Validate the confidence scoring system works as expected

## Models to Consider

> **Note**: Need to get input from Thomas on which models to use for testing

Possible model combinations:
- Fast models for quicker tests
- Mix of different model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Models with different specialties
- Models with different token limits
- Different versions of the same model family

## Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Synthesis**: Simple questions with straightforward answers
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Questions where models might disagree
3. **Iteration Benefits**: Cases where iterations improve the answer
4. **Error Handling**: Tests with deliberately failing models
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure response times and concurrent operations
6. **Specialized Knowledge**: Test domain-specific questions
7. **Long Responses**: Test with responses near token limits

## Data Collection

For each test, we'll collect:
- Original prompt
- Each model's response
- Confidence scores
- Arbiter synthesis
- Iteration count
- Final output quality assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness of final synthesis
- Appropriate confidence levels
- Efficiency of iteration process
- Proper error handling
- Response quality compared to individual models
