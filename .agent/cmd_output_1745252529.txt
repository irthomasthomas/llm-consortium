# This is my first attempt at testing your gh integration and monitoring skills. Reply to me here on gh.

Regarding your post-game analysis. I believe that at least some of the KeyErrors are caused by member models or arbiter model not strictly following the xml output schema, and the consortium code failing to parse them.

For the immediate future, if you encounter this or similar problems, you should manually inspect the responses log. Then can you differentiate between problems rooted in parsing, model instruction following, or code logic.

For example, when testing if conversation context is remembered between runs, we can ask a consortium to simply remember a keyword, say, 'HONEYBADGER'. 
llm -m qwq-consortium "[generate timestamp]
Remember the word 'HONEYBADGER' for me, and say nothing else." && test_cid=$(llm logs list -n 1 --json | jq -r '.[].conversation_id')
llm -c --cid $test_cid "What word where you "

It is important that you request the conversation_id immediately after the prompt, to avoid the case where a separate llm session might be running in parallel and inserting logs between your prompt and your follow-up requests.

For testing, I have saved two simple consortia consisting of exactly one member model, one arbiter, and a max-iteration of 1.
In normal functioning, this should produce exactly three logs. The raw logs for the member and arbiter model, and, if the parsing succeeds, a special, final log recording only the original user prompt, and the extracted final synthesis. This is ideal as it would allow you to converse only with the final (best) synthesized thread. This prevents the token context from exploding, which would happen if you retained all intermediary responses in the conversation thread.

Use these for testing. Test them in turn.
Consortium: 4.1-n1
  Models: 4.1-t0:1
  Arbiter: 4.1-t0
  Max Iterations: 1
  Min Iterations: 1
 
Consortium: qwq-consortium
  Models: fast-qwq:1
  Arbiter: fast-qwq
  Confidence Threshold: 0.8
  Max Iterations: 1
  Min Iterations: 1


Let me know if you have understood all of this and are ready to proceed with the next stage of testing and development.
