Your primary goal is to assist the user by executing commands, managing files, reasoning through problems, and providing accurate final answers.\n\n**Interaction Flow:**\n1.  **User Request:** You receive a request from the user, potentially enhanced with context (files, search results, memories).\n2.  **Reasoning & Planning:** Analyze the request. Use the `<REASONING>` tag to explain your thought process and the `<PLAN>` tag to outline the steps you will take.\n3.  **Action:** Choose ONE of the following actions per turn:\n    *   **`<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>`:** Execute a Zsh shell command. Assume standard Linux utilities are available (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `python`, `git`, etc.). You will receive the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Handle potential errors. Use `cat` for file content, but be mindful of large files (output might be truncated). **Strongly prefer this for modifying parts of existing files (e.g., using `sed -i`).**\n    *   **`<WRITE_FILES>...</WRITE_FILES>`:** Write content to one or more files. Inside this block, use `<file path=\"/path/to/filename.ext\\\">File content</file>` to specify the file path and content. **CRITICAL WARNING: Use this ONLY for creating NEW files or COMPLETELY OVERWRITING existing files. You MUST provide the ENTIRE intended final content for the file. Failure to do so WILL corrupt the file.**\n    *   **`<MEMORY>text to remember</MEMORY>`:** Store a piece of information in your long-term memory. Keep it concise.\n    *   **`<FINAL_ANSWER>answer</FINAL_ANSWER>`:** Provide the final answer to the user's request when you are confident the task is complete.\n4.  **Verification (Mandatory after file modification):** If your action involved modifying a file (using `<WRITE_FILES>` or `<COMMAND>`), your *next* action MUST be a verification step (e.g., `<COMMAND>cat path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>git diff path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>ls -l path/to/file</COMMAND>`) to confirm the change was successful and the file content is correct before proceeding with other tasks. Explain this verification in your `<REASONING>`.\n5.  **Feedback:** You receive feedback based on your action (command output, file write status, memory confirmation).\n6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 based on the feedback until the task is complete. Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n7.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm_generator \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```xml\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you are using them as part of a command.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses. Tags must be formatted as <TAG>content</TAG>, not as `<TAG>` or any other format. Required tags include <COMMAND>, <WRITE_FILES>, <REASONING>, <FINAL_ANSWER>, <PLAN>, and <MEMORY>.\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\\n\\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses.

Read the content of `TODO.md` to understand the reported problem and any initial insights.\n2.  Examine the Python files within the `llm_consortium` directory (`arbiter_prompt.xml`, `__init__.py`, `iteration_prompt.txt`, `system_prompt.txt`) and also relevant files within the wider `llm` project structure if needed (e.g., core `llm` code related to model handling, conversation management, and plugin configuration). Focus on areas potentially related to `conversation_id`, message propagation, and response handling.\n3.  Use `cat` commands to retrieve the content of these files.\n4.  Analyze the retrieved code and the provided `llm_answer` explanation and context points:\n    *   Why isn't the `conversation_id` being passed between calls within the consortium logic?\n    *   Why are `conversation_id` and `parent_id` potentially missing from the `LLMResponse` objects generated by the consortium models?\n    *   How does the plugin configuration or initialization (`__init__.py`, potentially external to the plugin code if needed for wider LLM context) differ between a standalone model and the consortium, and how might this affect state management?\n5.  Synthesize the findings into a clear explanation of the root cause(s).\n6.  Develop a step-by-step plan to modify the code to ensure `conversation_id` is correctly managed, propagated, and included in responses.\n7.  Present your plan and explain how the proposed changes will address the identified issues.\n\nYou may need to ask follow-up questions if crucial information is missing or unclear from the files you initially examine.\n\nSave all gathered file content and relevant notes to `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/.agent/context/gathered_context.txt` as you proceed.\n\nBegin by reading `TODO.md`.<SUGGESTIONS>**Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution:**\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**  \nThe `llm-consortium` plugin fails to persist `conversation_id` (CID) due to:\n1. **Missing CID Propagation** in `ConsortiumOrchestrator` logic.\n2. **No CID Storage** in responses from consortium models (vs standalone models like `fast-qwq` that handle this inherently).\n3. **Orchestrator Initialization** lacks statefulness to track CID across requests.\n\n---\n\n**Fix Implementation Plan**  \n\n1. **Modify Response Handling**  \n   Update `ConsortiumOrchestrator` to inject/reuse CID in responses:  \n   ```python\n   # In llm_consortium/__init__.py\n   class ConsortiumOrchestrator:\n       async def orchestrate(self, prompt, conversation_id=None):\n           current_cid = conversation_id or generate_new_cid()\n           # Propagate current_cid to all consortium models\n           responses = await self._get_model_responses(prompt, cid=current_cid)\n           return LLMResponse(\n               content=synthesis_result, \n               conversation_id=current_cid,\n               parent_id=generate_parent_id()\n           )\n   ```\n\n2. **Add CID to Model Interactions**  \n   Ensure models receive CID in requests:  \n   ```python\n   async def _get_model_response(self, model, prompt, cid=None):\n       response = await model.prompt(\n           prompt, \n           conversation_id=cid  # Critical addition\n       )\n       return response\n   ```\n\n3. **Update CLI Integration**  \n   Modify plugin entry points to forward CID from user input:  \n   ```python\n   # In plugin registration (e.g., plugin.py)\n   @hookimpl\n   def register_commands(cli):\n       @cli.command()\n       def consortium_query(prompt, cid=None):\n           orchestrator = ConsortiumOrchestrator()\n           return orchestrator.orchestrate(prompt, conversation_id=cid)\n   ```\n\n4. **Enforce CID Persistence in Config**  \n   Extend `ConsortiumConfig` to track session state:  \n   ```python\n   class ConsortiumConfig(BaseModel):\n       active_conversations: Dict[str, str] = {}  # CID -> last_parent_id\n       # ... other fields ...\n   ```\n\n---\n\n**Verification Steps**  \n1. Test CID persistence across sequential requests without manually specifying `--cid`:  \n   ```bash\n   llm \"First message\" -m qwq-consortium | grep \"CID:\"  # Extract CID\n   llm \"Follow-up\" -m qwq-consortium  # Should auto-use previous CID\n   ```\n2. Validate `LLMResponse` objects contain matching CIDs and parent IDs.  \n\n**Key Files to Modify**  \n- `llm_consortium/__init__.py`: Add CID args to methods, update config.\n- `llm_consortium/plugin.py`: Forward CLI `--cid` parameter to orchestrator.\n- Tests: Add CID persistence checks in `test_llm_consortium.py`.\n\n**Outcome**  \nThe consortium plugin will maintain conversation context identically to standalone models by ensuring CIDs flow through all orchestration layers and responses.</SUGGESTIONS>"

          "content": "<REASONING>\nThe necessary file contents (`TODO.md`, `arbiter_prompt.xml`, `__init__.py`, `iteration_prompt.txt`, `system_prompt.txt`) have been gathered into `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/.agent/context/gathered_context.txt`.\n\nNow, I will analyze this content to identify the root cause of the `conversation_id` (CID) persistence issue and formulate a plan to fix it.\n\n**Analysis Summary based on gathered context:**\n\n1.  **`TODO.md`:** Explicitly states the problem: consortium models start new conversations instead of continuing existing ones, unlike standalone models. It correctly identifies that the `--cid` (which maps to `conversation_id` internally) is not being reused.\n2.  **`__init__.py`:** This file contains the core logic, including the `ConsortiumModel` class which inherits from `llm.Model`.\n    *   The critical method is `ConsortiumModel.execute()`. This method receives `prompt`, `stream`, `response`, `conversation` kwargs. Notably, it *does not* explicitly list `conversation_id` in its signature, but it should receive it via `**kwargs` if `llm` passes it.\n    *   Inside `execute`, it initializes a `ConsortiumOrchestrator`.\n    *   The `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate()` method is called. Let's examine its signature and logic. It takes `prompt_text` but *not* `conversation_id`.\n    *   Within `orchestrate`, it calls `_get_model_responses`. This method calls `llm.get_model(model_name).prompt(...)` for each member model. Crucially, it calls `.prompt(current_prompt)` **without passing any `conversation_id`**. This is a primary point of failure. The member models are invoked without the context of the ongoing conversation ID.\n    *   Finally, `ConsortiumModel.execute` takes the result from the orchestrator and yields `Response` chunks. It *does* construct a final `Response` object. However, the `ConsortiumOrchestrator` doesn't seem designed to track or return the `conversation_id`. Even if `execute` *received* a `conversation_id`, it's not clear if it's consistently used when creating the final `Response` object returned to the `llm` framework. The `llm` framework relies on the `response.conversation_id` attribute of the *returned* response to know which conversation to continue next time.\n3.  **Prompts (`arbiter_prompt.xml`, etc.):** These define the text interaction structure but don't manage the `llm` framework's conversation tracking mechanism (the CID).\n\n**Root Cause Identification:**\n\nThe `llm-consortium` plugin fails to persist `conversation_id` due to two main issues in the `llm_consortium/__init__.py` code:\n\n1.  **Missing CID Propagation to Member Models:** The `ConsortiumOrchestrator._get_model_responses` method calls the `prompt()` method of each member model *without* passing the `conversation_id` from the initial user request. Consequently, each member model interaction potentially starts a new conversation log in the `llm` database, disconnected from the main conversation thread.\n2.  **Missing CID Handling in Orchestrator/Response:** The `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate` method does not accept `conversation_id` as a parameter, nor does it seem designed to retrieve or manage it. Subsequently, the final `llm.Response` object constructed or returned by `ConsortiumModel.execute` might lack the correct `conversation_id`. When `llm` receives a response without a CID, it cannot link the next prompt to the previous one and thus starts a new conversation.\n\n**Plan to Fix the Issue:**\n\nThe fix involves ensuring the `conversation_id` is threaded through the consortium's execution flow:\n\n1.  **Modify `ConsortiumModel.execute`:**\n    *   Explicitly accept `conversation_id` (it likely comes via `**kwargs`, but accessing it reliably is key). Store it in a variable.\n    *   Pass this `conversation_id` when initializing or calling the `ConsortiumOrchestrator`.\n\n2.  **Modify `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate`:**\n    *   Add `conversation_id` as an explicit parameter.\n    *   Pass this `conversation_id` down to the `_get_model_responses` method.\n\n3.  **Modify `ConsortiumOrchestrator._get_model_responses` (and potentially `_get_model_response` if refactored):**\n    *   Ensure this method accepts the `conversation_id`.\n    *   When calling `model.prompt(...)` for each member model, pass the `conversation_id` using the `conversation_id=cid` keyword argument: `await model.prompt(current_prompt, conversation_id=conversation_id)`.\n\n4.  **Ensure Final Response Contains CID:**\n    *   The `ConsortiumModel.execute` method needs to ensure the final `llm.Response` object it constructs (or the one received from the orchestrator if it generates one) has its `.conversation_id` attribute set to the *original* `conversation_id` received from the `llm` framework. If a new conversation was implicitly started (e.g., first message), the `Response` object automatically generated by `llm` usually handles this, but it's crucial the consortium doesn't lose or overwrite it. The key is passing the *existing* CID if one was provided.\n\n**(Self-Correction based on suggestions):** The user-provided suggestions outline a similar approach, focusing on injecting the CID into `orchestrate`, passing it to model calls, and ensuring the final `LLMResponse` (or `llm.Response`) contains it. The plan above aligns with this. The suggestion about modifying CLI integration (`plugin.py`) and `ConsortiumConfig` might be necessary depending on how the plugin is registered and if session state needs more complex management, but the core issue lies within the request execution flow in `__init__.py`. We start by fixing the flow.\n</REASONING>\n<FINAL_ANSWER>\n**Analysis of the `conversation_id` Persistence Issue in `llm-consortium`**\n\nBased on the gathered files (`TODO.md`, `__init__.py`, prompt files) and the user's description, the root cause of the `conversation_id` (CID) persistence failure in the `llm-consortium` plugin has been identified:\n\n1.  **Missing CID Propagation to Member Models:** The core execution logic, primarily within `ConsortiumOrchestrator._get_model_responses` inside `llm_consortium/__init__.py`, invokes the `prompt()` method of the individual member models *without* passing the `conversation_id` that was provided with the user's request. Each call to a member model effectively starts a new, independent interaction from the perspective of `llm`'s history tracking.\n2.  **Missing CID Handling in Orchestration and Response:** The `ConsortiumOrchestrator` class methods (`orchestrate`, `_get_model_responses`) do not explicitly accept or manage the `conversation_id`. Consequently, the final `llm.Response` object generated by the consortium model might not have the correct `conversation_id` set. The `llm` framework relies on this ID in the response to link subsequent prompts in the same conversation. If the ID is missing or incorrect, `llm` initiates a new conversation.\n\n**Plan to Fix the Issue**\n\nThe following steps should be taken, primarily modifying `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/llm_consortium/__init__.py`:\n\n1.  **Update `ConsortiumModel.execute`:**\n    *   Ensure it correctly captures the `conversation_id` passed by the `llm` framework (likely via `**kwargs`). Store this value (it might be `None` for a new conversation).\n    *   Pass this captured `conversation_id` to the `ConsortiumOrchestrator` when calling its `orchestrate` method.\n\n2.  **Update `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate`:**\n    *   Modify the method signature to accept `conversation_id` (e.g., `async def orchestrate(self, prompt_text, conversation_id=None):`).\n    *   Pass this `conversation_id` down when calling `_get_model_responses`.\n\n3.  **Update `ConsortiumOrchestrator._get_model_responses`:**\n    *   Modify the method signature to accept `conversation_id`.\n    *   Inside the loop where member models are called, modify the `model.prompt()` call to explicitly pass the `conversation_id`:\n        ```python\n        # Example modification within _get_model_responses loop\n        response = await model.prompt(\n            current_prompt, \n            conversation_id=conversation_id # Pass the received CID here\n        )\n        ```\n\n4.  **Ensure Correct CID in Final Response:**\n    *   Verify that the `llm.Response` object ultimately yielded or returned by `ConsortiumModel.execute` has its `.conversation_id` attribute set correctly. If the orchestrator synthesizes a final response object, ensure it carries the original `conversation_id`. If `execute` wraps the result, it must ensure the CID is preserved. The goal is that the `Response` object returned to the `llm` framework reflects the correct conversation context.\n\nThese changes ensure that the `conversation_id` is threaded through the entire execution path of the consortium plugin, allowing `llm` to correctly manage conversation history just like it does for standalone models.\n</FINAL_ANSWER>"

The analysis, based on the provided context (`TODO.md`), user description, and examination of the plugin's code (`llm_consortium/__init__.py`, prompt files), identified the following:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The primary issue lies within the `ConsortiumModel` and `ConsortiumOrchestrator` classes in `llm_consortium/__init__.py`. The `conversation_id` provided by the `llm` framework during a follow-up request is not being correctly passed down through the layers of the consortium's execution flow. Specifically, the `ConsortiumOrchestrator._get_model_responses` method calls the underlying member models (`model.prompt(...)`) without including the necessary `conversation_id` argument. Furthermore, the final `llm.Response` generated by the consortium might not consistently carry the original conversation ID back to the `llm` framework, preventing proper session tracking.\n*   **Contrast with Standalone Models:** Standalone models interact directly with the `llm` framework's conversation management, which handles CID persistence automatically when the `model.prompt()` method is called correctly and the returned `Response` includes the CID. The consortium adds intermediate layers (`ConsortiumOrchestrator`) that currently break this chain.\n\n**Plan for Resolution:**\n\nThe proposed solution involves modifying the plugin's Python code (`/home/thomas/Projects/llm/plugins/Utilities/llm-consortium/llm_consortium/__init__.py`) to correctly thread the `conversation_id`:\n\n1.  **Capture CID:** Ensure `ConsortiumModel.execute` captures the incoming `conversation_id` (likely from `**kwargs`).\n2.  **Propagate CID:** Pass the captured CID down to `ConsortiumOrchestrator.orchestrate`.\n3.  **Pass CID to Orchestrator Methods:** Modify `orchestrate` and `_get_model_responses` signatures to accept the CID.\n4.  **Inject CID into Member Calls:** Modify the `model.prompt(...)` call within `_get_model_responses` to include the `conversation_id=cid` argument.\n5.  **Ensure Final Response CID:** Make certain the final `llm.Response` returned by `ConsortiumModel.execute` correctly includes the original `conversation_id`.\n\nThis plan addresses the identified points of failure and should align the consortium's behavior with that of standalone models regarding conversation persistence.\n</FINAL_ANSWER>"
