Your primary goal is to assist the user by executing commands, managing files, reasoning through problems, and providing accurate final answers.\n\n**Interaction Flow:**\n1.  **User Request:** You receive a request from the user, potentially enhanced with context (files, search results, memories).\n2.  **Reasoning & Planning:** Analyze the request. Use the `<REASONING>` tag to explain your thought process and the `<PLAN>` tag to outline the steps you will take.\n3.  **Action:** Choose ONE of the following actions per turn:\n    *   **`<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>`:** Execute a Zsh shell command. Assume standard Linux utilities are available (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `python`, `git`, etc.). You will receive the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Handle potential errors. Use `cat` for file content, but be mindful of large files (output might be truncated). **Strongly prefer this for modifying parts of existing files (e.g., using `sed -i`).**\n    *   **`<WRITE_FILES>...</WRITE_FILES>`:** Write content to one or more files. Inside this block, use `<file path=\"/path/to/filename.ext\\\">File content</file>` to specify the file path and content. **CRITICAL WARNING: Use this ONLY for creating NEW files or COMPLETELY OVERWRITING existing files. You MUST provide the ENTIRE intended final content for the file. Failure to do so WILL corrupt the file.**\n    *   **`<MEMORY>text to remember</MEMORY>`:** Store a piece of information in your long-term memory. Keep it concise.\n    *   **`<FINAL_ANSWER>answer</FINAL_ANSWER>`:** Provide the final answer to the user's request when you are confident the task is complete.\n4.  **Verification (Mandatory after file modification):** If your action involved modifying a file (using `<WRITE_FILES>` or `<COMMAND>`), your *next* action MUST be a verification step (e.g., `<COMMAND>cat path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>git diff path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>ls -l path/to/file</COMMAND>`) to confirm the change was successful and the file content is correct before proceeding with other tasks. Explain this verification in your `<REASONING>`.\n5.  **Feedback:** You receive feedback based on your action (command output, file write status, memory confirmation).\n6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 based on the feedback until the task is complete. Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n7.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm_generator \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```xml\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you are using them as part of a command.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses. Tags must be formatted as <TAG>content</TAG>, not as `<TAG>` or any other format. Required tags include <COMMAND>, <WRITE_FILES>, <REASONING>, <FINAL_ANSWER>, <PLAN>, and <MEMORY>.\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\\n\\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses.

Examine the content of the `llm-consortium` plugin files, particularly `llm_consortium/strategies/default.py` and `llm_consortium/arbiter_prompt.xml`, `llm_consortium/iteration_prompt.txt`, to understand how conversation state is intended to be saved and loaded.\n2.  Examine `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm/docs/python-api.md` and potentially other files in the `/home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm/` directory to understand how the core LLM CLI handles conversation IDs and state for plugins.\n3.  Based on the findings, formulate a hypothesis explaining why the state persistence might be failing for the consortium plugin across separate invocations.\n4.  Determine the next step to verify the hypothesis, which may involve:\n    *   Adding logging to the plugin code to track state saving/loading.\n    *   Manually inspecting the expected state file directory to see if files are being created/updated.\n    *   Constructing a minimal test case command that demonstrates the failure.\n    *   Potentially modifying the plugin code to fix the issue.\n\nBegin by reading the relevant plugin code files and the LLM CLI documentation.\n\n<COMMAND>cat llm_consortium/strategies/default.py</COMMAND>\n<COMMAND>cat llm_consortium/arbiter_prompt.xml</COMMAND>\n<COMMAND>cat llm_consortium/iteration_prompt.txt</COMMAND>\n<COMMAND>cat /home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm/docs/python-api.md</COMMAND>\n</user_request>\n\n<FILE_CONTEXT><file path=\"llm_consortium/strategies/default.py\">This Python module implements `DefaultStrategy`, part of a consortium strategy for managing AI model orchestration. Key features include:\n\n1. **State Storage Mechanism**:\n   - Stores conversation state in JSON files under a designated directory (determined by `get_consortium_state_dir`).\n   - Directory location:\n     - Checked via `LLM_USER_PATH` environment variable first.\n     - Falls back to OS-specific app data dir (via `click.get_app_dir`) for \"io.datasette.llm\" + subdirectory `consortium_state` if the env var isn't set.\n   - Each conversation has a separate file like `conv_{conversation_id}.json`.\n\n2. **Strategy Behavior**:\n   - **Model Usage**: Selects all configured models, applies no response filtering, and passes raw outputs to synthesis.\n   - **Conversation Persistence**: Maintains conversation history between calls using a `conversation_id`:\n     - Load/restore past interactions from disk if `conversation_id` exists.\n     - Auto-saves state after each orchestration run.\n\n3. **Core Methods**:\n   - `__init__()`: Initializes with initial `conversation_id` from strategy parameters.\n   - `set_conversation_id()`: Updates the ID (e.g., for new interactions) and reloads state if changed.\n   - `_load_state()`: Reads prior state from disk (or defaults to empty state on error).\n   - `_save_state()`: Persists current state to the configured directory.\n   - `initialize_state()`: Refreshes state when `conversation_id` changes (triggers state reloading on ID updates).\n\n4. **State Data Structure**:\n   - State files contain a dictionary with at least `history` (containing prior interactions) and `iteration` (tracking turn count).\n   - State is reloaded fromdisk when starting a new orchestrate run with an existing conversation ID.\n\nThis implementation ensures conversational continuity by persisting interaction records and iteration counts, while allowing flexible model selection without intermediate response processing.\n[File truncated due to size]</file><file path=\"tests/test_llm_consortium.py\">import

process inputs and log responses. Key components and features include:\n\n1. **Core Imports**: Uses SQLite for logging, Pydantic for data validation, and threading for concurrency-safe operations.\n\n2. **Prompts**: Reads system prompts from files:\n   - System prompt (system_prompt.txt)\n   - Arbiter prompt (arbiter_prompt.xml)\n   - Iteration prompt (iteration_prompt.txt)\n\n3. **Logging**:\n   - Stores logs in a SQLite database (`logs.db`)\n   - Writes to both a log file (consortium.log) and stderr\n   - Logs warning if model responses are truncated (detects reasons like \"max_tokens\" or \"length\")\n\n4. **Database Management**:\n   - Thread-safe SQLite connections via `DatabaseConnection`\n   - Uses thread-local storage for connection management\n\n5. **Model Response Handling**:\n   - Tracks \"finish reason\" to detect truncation\n   - Validates LLM API responses across different provider formats (e.g., OpenAI vs. Anthropic)\n\n6. **Configuration**:\n   - `ConsortiumConfig` defines supported models with weight/priority values\n   - `IterationContext` holds synthesis data and model outputs between processing steps\n\n7. **Pending Features** (TODOs indicate incomplete work):\n   - Support for continuation models (Claude, Deepseek)\n   - Consistent handling of different API response formats\n   - Full implementation of iteration/continuation logic\n\n8. **Error Handling**:\n   - Robust error handling for prompt loading and database writes\n   - Separate logging for debug and error messages\n\nThe system is designed to run LLM models in parallel (using concurrent.futures) while maintaining thread safety and persistent logging of all model interactions. It emphasizes detecting truncation issues to maintain output quality.\n[File truncated due to size]</file><file path=\"llm_consortium/strategies/factory.py\">This code file manages the creation and loading of strategy implementations for a consortium system. Here's the summary of critical information:\n\nStrategies are organized via a registry and dynamic import mechanisms:\n\n1. **Strategy Registry (_strategy_registry):**\n   - A dictionary mapping strategy names (lowercase) to their implementation classes.\n   - Starts with the mandatory `default` entry (`DefaultStrategy`).\n   - Additional strategies like `round_robin` could be added here as implementations are developed.\n\n2. **Factory Function (`create_strategy`):**\n   - Uses **registry first**: Checks `_strategy_registry` for the requested `strategy_name`.\n   - If missing, attempts **dynamic class discovery**:\n     - Imports a module using `<strategy_name>` as module name (e.g., `\"my_strategy\"` \u2794 `import .my_strategy`).\n     - Looks for a class named `<CamelCaseStrategyName>` (e.g., `MyStrategyStrategy`).\n   - Returns an initialized instance of the strategy class.\n\n3. **Fallback & Error Handling:**\n   - Fallbacks to `default` strategy only if no `strategy_name` or empty string is provided.\n   - Raises `ValueError` if strategy cannot be found/loaded via both methods.\n   - Logs debug messages for all loading attempts and failures.\n\n4. **Design Extensibility:**\n   - **Explicit registration support**: Includes commented placeholder for `register_strategy()` allowing programmatic registration of implementations.\n   - **Convention-based extension**: New strategies can be added simply by:\n     1. Creating a module named `<strategy_name>`.\n     2. Defining a class named `SomeStrategyConventionStrategy` in that module.\n     3. The class must inherit from `ConsortiumStrategy`.\n\n5. **Key Features:**\n   - **Lazy loading**: Module is only imported when the strategy name is requested.\n   - **Parameterized initialization**: Uses `params` dictionary passed to the strategy's constructor.\n   - **Type-checking**: Ensures registered/dynamically loaded classes are subclasses of `ConsortiumStrategy`.\n\n6. **Logging:**\n   - Uses the `logger` to report loading attempts, successes/failures, and parameters used.\n\nThis system prioritizes explicit registry entries but provides a flexible naming convention path for adding new strategies without code changes to the registry itself.\n[File truncated due to size]</file><file path=\"/home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm/docs/python-api.md\">**Python API Summary**\n\nThe LLM Python API allows interaction with models for generating responses, including plugins. Key features and parameters are outlined below:\n\n### Basic Prompt Execution\n- **Model Initialization**: \n  ```python\n  model = llm.get_model(\"model-id\", key=\"api_key\")  # Optional key (via env var `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `keys.json`)\n  ```\n- **Prompt Execution**: Use `model.prompt(prompt_text)`; the response is lazily evaluated (executed when `response.text()` or `str(response)` is called).\n- **Response Handling**: \n  - `response.text()`: Retrieves generated text.\n  - Default model is `gpt-4o-mini` unless configured otherwise.\n\n### System Prompts\n- Add `system=\"...\"` to `prompt()` to set system instructions (e.g., `\"Answer like GlaDOS\"`).\n\n### Attachments (Multi-Modal Input)\n- Supported for models with `model.attachment_types` (e.g., images). Use `Attachment` objects with paths, URLs, or raw data:\n  ```python\n  attachments = [llm.Attachment(path=\"image.jpg\"), llm.Attachment(url=\"...\")]\n  response = model.prompt(\"Describe images\", attachments=attachments)\n  ```\n\n### Schema Validation\n- **Enforce Output Structure** via JSON Schema:\n  - Direct schema dict:\n    ```python\n    schema = {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {...}}\n    ```\n  - **Pydantic Models**:\n    ```python\n    class Dog(BaseModel): \n      name: str; age: int\n    response = model.prompt(\"...\", schema=Dog)\n    ```\n  - **Schema DSL Helper**:\n    ```python\n    llm.schema_dsl(\"name, age int, bio\")  # Generates schema for single item\n    llm.schema_dsl(..., multi=True)  # For multiple items\n    ```\n\n### Fragment System\n- Embed fragments (e.g., documents) via `fragments` and `system_fragments` in `prompt()`:\n  ```python\n  response = model.prompt(\n      \"Analyze these documents\",\n      fragments=[open(\"file1.txt\").read(), \"...\"],\n      system_fragments=[\"Behave as a researcher\"]\n  )\n  ```\n\n### Errors\n- **Invalid Model ID**: Raises `llm.UnknownModelError`.\n\n### Configuration\n- List models: `llm models` command.\n- Lazy Execution: Prompt isn\u2019t processed until the response is accessed (via `text()`/`str()`).\n\nThis API supports structured outputs, multi-modal inputs, and integration with environment variables/keys.json for API keys.\n[File truncated due to size]</file></FILE_CONTEXT><WEB_SEARCH_RESULTS><search query=\"how\">Search timed out</search><search query=\"persisting conversation state across cli invocations with llm consortium strategy\">Search timed out</search><search query=\"python api for conversation state management in llm cli\">Search timed out</search></WEB_SEARCH_RESULTS><USER_RESPONSES><question>Do you expect the consortium plugin to automatically track previous interactions using conversation IDs (--cid) like individual models?</question><answer type=\"llm\">Yes. The DefaultStrategy in the consortium plugin persists conversation state using `conversation_id`, auto-loading prior interactions from disk whenever the same ID is reused. State is stored in JSON files tied to each `conversation_id`, ensuring continuity across invocations. Changing the ID via `set_conversation_id` triggers state reloading, while existing IDs restore history and iteration counts.</answer><question>Should the consortiums state persistence use local storage, a database, or depend on LLM providers native conversation feature?</question><answer type=\"llm\">The consortium's state persistence uses **local storage** (JSON files) to store conversation state, as specified in the `DefaultStrategy` implementation. It stores these files in a designated directory determined by either the `LLM_USER_PATH` environment variable or an OS-specific app data directory. There is no mention of using a database (like SQLite) for state storage\u2014SQLite is only referenced for logging purposes. The system does not rely on LLM providers' native conversation features; instead, it manages state internally through files. \\n\\nAnswer: NO.</answer></USER_RESPONSES><COMMAND_OUTPUTS><command>grep -r conversation_id llm_consortium/strategies</command><output>\ntimeout: failed to run command \u2018eval\u2019: No such file or directory\nCommand execution failed or timed out\n</output><command>grep cid tests/test_llm_consortium.py</command><output>\ntimeout: failed to run command \u2018eval\u2019: No such file or directory\nCommand execution failed or timed out\n</output><command>cat llm_consortium/strategies/default.py | grep -A 5 orchestrate</command><output>\ntimeout: failed to run command \u2018eval\u2019: No such file or directory\nCommand execution failed or timed out\n</output><command>git diff llm_consortium/strategies/default.py # Check recent changes</command><output>\ntimeout: failed to run command \u2018eval\u2019: No such file or directory\nCommand execution failed or timed out\n</output></COMMAND_OUTPUTS>\\n\\n\n"

          "content": "**Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution:**\n\n**1. Key Issue Identification:**\nThe `llm-consortium` plugin's `DefaultStrategy` should persist conversation state via JSON files keyed by `conversation_id` but fails across CLI invocations. Key suspects include:\n- Missing/incorrect file paths for state storage\n- Failure to call `_save_state` after CLI runs\n- Improper handling of `--cid` parameter in consortium workflows\n\n**2. Verification Checklist:**\n- **File System Check:**\n  - Manually check state directory (`LLM_USER_PATH` or OS app dir) for `conv_{cid}.json` files after running commands with `--cid`\n  - Verify write permissions: `touch conv_test.json` in the directory\n- **Code Analysis:**\n  - Confirm `_save_state` is called **after** orchestration completes in `DefaultStrategy` methods\n  - Check if CLI passes `conversation_id` to the consortium plugin when `--cid` is used (compare with individual model handling)\n\n**3. Hypothesis:**\nThe plugin isn't receiving/saving the `conversation_id` for consortium instances due to:\n- Missing parameter binding in CLI integration code (not shown in context)\n- Strategy initialization not propagating `conversation_id` during orchestrate runs\n\n**4. Debugging Implementation Steps:**\n\n**a. Add Debug Logging to `default.py`:**\n```python\n# In _save_state():\ndef _save_state(self):\n    state_path = self._state_path()\n    print(f\"SAVING STATE TO: {state_path}\")  # Log path\n    try:\n        with open(state_path, \"w\") as f:\n            json.dump(self.state, f)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"SAVE FAILED: {str(e)}\")  # Capture errors\n\n# In _load_state():\ndef _load_state(self):\n    state_path = self._state_path()\n    print(f\"LOADING STATE FROM: {state_path}\")  # Log path\n    try:\n        with open(state_path, \"r\") as f:\n            return json.load(f)\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"NO PRIOR STATE FOUND\")\n        return {\"history\": [], \"iteration\": 0}\n```\n\n**b. Test Command Sequence:**\n```bash\n# First invocation (start new conversation)\nllm --cid test-convo-1234 -m consortium:qwq-consortium \"First prompt\"\n\n# Second invocation (reuse CID)\nllm --cid test-convo-1234 -m consortium:qwq-consortium \"Follow-up question\"\n```\n\n**c. Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**\n- **Expected:** `conv_test-convo-1234.json` appears in state dir after first run and updates on second run\n- **Failure Modes:**\n  - No file created: Path construction error or permissions\n  - File not updated: `_save_state` not called after orchestration\n  - Empty history: `conversation_id` not properly bound to state\n\n**5. Most Likely Fix:**\nIf logging shows `_save_state` isn't called, modify the `DefaultStrategy` to ensure state is persisted **after every `orchestrate()` execution** in `llm_consortium/strategies/default.py`:\n```python\nclass DefaultStrategy:\n    async def orchestrate(self, prompt: str):\n        # ... existing orchestration logic ...\n        self._save_state()  # Explicit save after completion\n        return result\n```\n\n**Confirmation Test:**  \nManually check state file timestamps between invocations\u2014modification times should update on each run.\n\n**Failure Resolution Paths:**\n| Issue                         | Solution                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No state dir exists           | Add directory creation logic to `_save_state()`                          |\n| Missing CID parameter binding | Update CLI integration to pass `--cid` to strategy initialization        |\n| Race Conditions               | Implement file locking during I/O operations (e.g., `fcntl` or `os.lockf`) | \n\n**Post-Fix Validation:**  \nAdd a test case in `tests/test_llm_consortium.py` that verifies state persistence across two orchestrate calls with the same CID. This ensures regression prevention."

Your primary goal is to assist the user by executing commands, managing files, reasoning through problems, and providing accurate final answers.\n\n**Interaction Flow:**\n1.  **User Request:** You receive a request from the user, potentially enhanced with context (files, search results, memories).\n2.  **Reasoning & Planning:** Analyze the request. Use the `<REASONING>` tag to explain your thought process and the `<PLAN>` tag to outline the steps you will take.\n3.  **Action:** Choose ONE of the following actions per turn:\n    *   **`<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>`:** Execute a Zsh shell command. Assume standard Linux utilities are available (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `python`, `git`, etc.). You will receive the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Handle potential errors. Use `cat` for file content, but be mindful of large files (output might be truncated). **Strongly prefer this for modifying parts of existing files (e.g., using `sed -i`).**\n    *   **`<WRITE_FILES>...</WRITE_FILES>`:** Write content to one or more files. Inside this block, use `<file path=\"/path/to/filename.ext\\\">File content</file>` to specify the file path and content. **CRITICAL WARNING: Use this ONLY for creating NEW files or COMPLETELY OVERWRITING existing files. You MUST provide the ENTIRE intended final content for the file. Failure to do so WILL corrupt the file.**\n    *   **`<MEMORY>text to remember</MEMORY>`:** Store a piece of information in your long-term memory. Keep it concise.\n    *   **`<FINAL_ANSWER>answer</FINAL_ANSWER>`:** Provide the final answer to the user's request when you are confident the task is complete.\n4.  **Verification (Mandatory after file modification):** If your action involved modifying a file (using `<WRITE_FILES>` or `<COMMAND>`), your *next* action MUST be a verification step (e.g., `<COMMAND>cat path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>git diff path/to/file</COMMAND>`, `<COMMAND>ls -l path/to/file</COMMAND>`) to confirm the change was successful and the file content is correct before proceeding with other tasks. Explain this verification in your `<REASONING>`.\n5.  **Feedback:** You receive feedback based on your action (command output, file write status, memory confirmation).\n6.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-5 based on the feedback until the task is complete. Use `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` on each turn to show how you are interpreting feedback and deciding the next step.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n\n1.  **Web Research:**\n    *   `bing_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `google_search -q \"query\" -n [1-50]`\n    *   `search_ddg \"query\"`\n    *   `search_terms_generator 'prompt, query or task description' -n=[1-9]` [--reasoning [1-9] # amount to think about the query before generating terms]\n\n2.  **System Interaction:**\n    *   `<COMMAND>command</COMMAND>` (Execute any shell command)\n    *   `<COMMAND>screenshot screen</COMMAND>` (Take a screenshot of the current screen)\n\n3.  **Memory Management:**\n    *   `add_memory \"information\"`\n    *   `memories`\n\n4.  **Data Collection:**\n    *   `fetch_web_page \"URL\"`\n    *   `prompt_the_user \"title\" \"question\"`\n\n5.  **Python Environment Management (uv):**\n    *   `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv venv`, `uv run`\n\n6.  **Progress Tracking (`/home/thomas/Projects/claude.sh/task_tracking/agent_controller.sh`):**\n    *   `note \"text\"`\n    *   `stage \"stagename\"`\n    *   `current`\n    *   `next`\n    *   `ask \"question\"`\n\n7.  **ShellLM Helper Functions (LLM Passthrough):**\n    *   Use these specialized functions via `<COMMAND>` for specific sub-tasks when direct execution or simple reasoning isn't enough. They wrap LLM calls, so you can pass standard `llm` options (e.g., `-m model_name`, `-o temperature=0.8`). Use them judiciously.\n    *   **When to Use:**\n        *   `structured_chain_of_thought \"problem\"`: Before complex planning, to break down the problem logically.\n        *   `task_plan_generator \"description\"`: Early in complex tasks to generate a high-level plan outline (often informed by `structured_chain_of_thought`).\n        *   `shelp \"task description\"`: When you need assistance formulating a specific shell command. **Use this if you are unsure about `sed` or other complex shell syntax.**\n        *   `commit_generator`: ONLY when specifically asked to generate a git commit message based on staged changes.\n        *   `brainstorm_generator \"topic\"`: When the user explicitly asks for brainstorming or idea generation.\n        *   `prompt_engineer \"prompt\"`: If you need to refine a complex prompt before using it (rarely needed for self-operation).\n        *   `search_engineer '<task/question>' --count=5 -m gemini-2`: Use **early** in research or problem-solving to generate diverse, effective search queries *before* using standard search commands (`bing_search`, etc.). Improves search quality and focuses effort.\n        *   `code_refactor [file_path]` (or pipe code): Use when asked to improve, analyze, or refactor existing code. Provides automated refactoring and expert analysis. Invoke via `<COMMAND>code_refactor path/to/file.ext --lang=language</COMMAND>` or `<COMMAND>cat code.ext | code_refactor --lang=language</COMMAND>`.\n    *   **Example:** `<COMMAND>shelp \"Use sed to replace 'foo' with 'bar' only on lines starting with '#' in config.txt\" -m claude-3.5-haiku</COMMAND>`\n    *   **Strategic Use:** Employ these tools appropriately to save time and minimize computational cost compared to achieving the same results through general reasoning or multiple steps.\n\n**File Handling:**\n\n*   **`<WRITE_FILES>` for NEW or COMPLETE OVERWRITE ONLY:**\n    *   **DANGER:** Incorrect use WILL corrupt files. Only use this if you intend to replace the *entire* file content or create a new file.\n    *   Provide the **ENTIRE**, **raw** content of each file directly between the `<file path=\"...\">` and `</file>` tags.\n    *   **Do NOT** wrap the content in extra quotes or escape characters like `\\\\n` or `\\\\\"` for JSON. The content should appear exactly as you want it written to the file.\n    *   Always use complete, absolute paths. Directories are created as needed.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```xml\n        <WRITE_FILES>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/script.py\">\n        # Entire script content goes here\n        import sys\n\n        print(\"Hello\\nWorld!\")\n        # Note: Raw newline above, not \\\\n\n\n        # Rest of the script...\n        </file>\n        <file path=\"/path/to/config.json\">\n        {\n            \"key\": \"value\",\n            \"list\": [1, 2, 3],\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"key\": \"value with \\\"quotes\\\"\"\n            }\n        }\n        # Note: Raw quotes above, not \\\\\"\n        # Note: This is the COMPLETE JSON content.\n        </file>\n        </WRITE_FILES>\n        ```\n\n*   **`<COMMAND>` (e.g., `sed`) for MODIFYING existing files:**\n    *   **PREFERRED METHOD FOR EDITS:** This is safer for making changes to existing files without risking accidental truncation.\n    *   Use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or custom scripts within a `<COMMAND>` tag.\n    *   Example: `<COMMAND>sed -i 's/original_text/new_text/g' /path/to/file.txt</COMMAND>`\n    *   **String Replacement Guidelines:**\n        1.  **Target Specificity**: Make search patterns as specific as possible. Use line numbers or unique anchors if possible.\n        2.  **Backup (If Risky)**: For complex changes, consider a backup first: `<COMMAND>cp /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.txt.bak</COMMAND>`. State this in your plan.\n        3.  **Complete Paths**: Always specify complete file paths.\n        4.  **Syntax Check:** If unsure about complex `sed` or `awk`, use `shelp` first.\n\n*   **Mandatory Verification:** AFTER EVERY `<COMMAND>` or `<WRITE_FILES>` that modifies a file, your NEXT action MUST be to verify the change (e.g., `cat file`, `git diff file`).\n\n**System Interaction:**\n\n*   Avoid interactive applications (e.g., nano, vim). Use `<WRITE_FILES>` or commands like `sed`.\n*   For user input, use: `<COMMAND>kdialog --inputbox \"Question\" \"Default Value\"</COMMAND>`\n*   Use the agent_controller.sh script to track your progress.\n\n**Memory:**\n\nUse `<MEMORY>` to store crucial information (e.g., successful commands, file paths, user preferences, discovered facts, **lessons learned from errors**). Access stored memories with the `memories` command.\n\n**Key Guidelines:**\n*   **XML Tags:** Strictly adhere to the specified XML tags. Content goes *between* tags.\n*   **One Action Per Turn:** Only use *one* primary action tag (`<COMMAND>`, `<WRITE_FILES>`, `<MEMORY>`, `<FINAL_ANSWER>`) per response. `<REASONING>` and `<PLAN>` are always allowed.\n*   **Shell Environment:** You are in Zsh on Linux. Standard commands are available. Be careful with commands that might hang. Use timeouts if needed.\n*   **File Paths:** Use absolute paths where possible.\n*   **Error Handling:** If a command fails, **STOP**. **Thoroughly analyze** the `Stdout/Stderr` and `Exit Code`. Explain the likely cause in `<REASONING>` and explicitly state how you are modifying your `<PLAN>` or command to address the specific error. **DO NOT BLINDLY REPEAT FAILING COMMANDS.** Use `shelp` if needed to fix shell syntax.\n*   **Verification:** **ALWAYS verify file modifications** in the next step before proceeding.\n*   **Conciseness:** Keep reasoning, plans, and memory entries concise but informative.\n*   **Context:** Pay attention to all provided context and feedback.\n*   **Completion:** Only use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` when the user's request is fully addressed. If providing code or file content, ensure it is complete and correct.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  Understand the request.\n2.  Plan your approach (`<PLAN>`).\n3.  Gather information (research, if needed).\n4.  Execute commands/write files.\n5.  **Verify modifications** immediately if files were changed.\n6.  Review results/feedback.\n7.  Store important findings/lessons (`<MEMORY>`).\n8.  Adjust plan and iterate until complete.\n9.  Present final solutions (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`).\n10. When a task is complete use `<FINAL_ANSWER>` to provide a final analysis identifying what went well, what challenges occurred, and lessons learned during the session.\n\nSEVERE WARNING: NEVER reference ANY of the above <tags> except when actively using them. You can write 'FINAL_ANSWER' in your response, but do not include the angle brackets unless you are using them as part of a command.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses. Tags must be formatted as <TAG>content</TAG>, not as `<TAG>` or any other format. Required tags include <COMMAND>, <WRITE_FILES>, <REASONING>, <FINAL_ANSWER>, <PLAN>, and <MEMORY>.\n</file>\n</WRITE_FILES>\\n\\nIMPORTANT: You MUST use proper XML tags for your responses.

Here is what I observe regarding state persistence and the use of `conversation_id`:\n\n- **State Directory and File Naming:** State is stored in a directory governed by `LLM_USER_PATH` or an OS app dir, with files named `conv_{conversation_id}.json`.\n- **State Loading:** The state (history and iteration) is loaded with `_load_state()` when `initialize_state()` is called, which happens after setting the `conversation_id`.\n- **Updating and Saving State:** The `update_state()` method appends to the history, increments the iteration count, and calls `_save_state()` if a `conversation_id` is set. This presumably happens after each orchestrate cycle.\n- **Key Design:** The persistence approach matches the intended workflow: if the same `conversation_id` is used in separate invocations, the state file for that ID should be loaded and updated.\n\n**Potential Issues to Investigate Next:**\n- Whether the CLI is correctly passing the `--cid` (`conversation_id`) into the plugin/strategy's `params`\n- Whether the `update_state()` method is called as intended after orchestration (some plugins require an explicit call)\n- Whether the orchestrator invokes `set_conversation_id()` before calling `orchestrate()` in each run (some systems may only set this internally)\n\n**Next Step:**  \nCheck how the LLM CLI integration passes the `conversation_id` to consortium plugins\u2014which could reveal if there\u2019s a disconnect between invoking with `--cid` and the plugin actually seeing that ID.\n</REASONING>\n\n<PLAN>\nExamine the LLM CLI or plugin wiring code to confirm whether the `conversation_id` (from the `--cid` argument) is being passed to the consortium strategy/plugin.

If I can't dynamically inspect, the next best step is to propose:\n1. Adding logging or assertion at the start of `DefaultStrategy.__init__` or `set_conversation_id` to print/show what `conversation_id` is actually seen.\n2. As a hotfix for local debugging: forcefully print `self.conversation_id` in those spots.\n\nThis will let us confirm whether the argument is being received and, if not, focus efforts on the CLI/plugin handoff.\n\n</REASONING>\n\n<PLAN>\nAdd a debug log or print statement in `DefaultStrategy.__init__` and/or `set_conversation_id` to determine at runtime what `conversation_id` is being received from the LLM CLI when invoked with `--cid`.
