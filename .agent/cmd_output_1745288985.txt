## Task #1 Results: Enhanced Keyword Memory Testing

Completed the enhanced keyword memory tests as outlined in the handoff document, using unique keywords for each consortium.

**Tests Performed:**
1.  **Consortium `4.1-n1` with keyword 'PLATYPUS':**
    *   Initial prompt: "Remember the word 'PLATYPUS' for me, and say nothing else."
    *   Follow-up prompt (`-c --cid <CID>`): "What word was I asked to remember in this conversation?"
2.  **Consortium `qwq-consortium` with keyword 'ECHIDNA':**
    *   Initial prompt: "Remember the word 'ECHIDNA' for me, and say nothing else."
    *   Follow-up prompt (`-c --cid <CID>`): "What word was I asked to remember in this conversation?"

---

**Result: Conversation Continuation Feature ✅ WORKS!**

In both tests, the follow-up prompt successfully triggered the consortium model to recall and output the correct keyword ('PLATYPUS' or 'ECHIDNA'), confirming that the conversation history is being loaded and passed to the plugin correctly using the `-c` and `--cid` flags.

---

**Log Verification Findings (Relevant to Next Task):**

During the required log verification step (`llm logs list --cid <CID> --json`), I observed a pattern that is important for Task #2 (Robust Synthesis Logging):

1.  **Log Entry Count:** For each consortium test run (initial prompt + follow-up prompt), filtering logs by the specific conversation ID resulted in a consistent **2 log entries** associated with the consortium model (e.g., `4.1-n1`, `qwq-consortium`).
    *   **Expected:** Based on the simple consortium setup (1 member, 1 arbiter, max_iterations=1), I expected to see 3 entries per run linked by CID: 1 member response, 1 arbiter response, and 1 final synthesized response (the one using the consortium name as the model).
    *   **Actual:** Only the final synthesized log entry for the initial prompt and the follow-up prompt were linked by CID and shown in `llm logs list --cid`. The individual member and arbiter responses were not present in this CID-filtered view.

2.  **Final Log Response Content:** The `response` field of the final synthesized log entries (the ones with `model` = consortium name, e.g., an ID like `01jscyj126zr8v3e3whxp2bs71`) still contains the **full XML output** from the synthesis process:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "01jscyj126zr8v3e3whxp2bs71",
      "model": "4.1-n1",
      "prompt": "Remember the word 'PLATYPUS' for me, and say nothing else.", # Correct - original prompt
      "response": "<think> ... full xml ... <synthesis> ... </synthesis> ... </synthesis_output>", # Issue: Contains full XML
      "conversation_id": "01jscyj1249c63h7t9g274676e",
      "datetime_utc": "..."
    }
    ```
    The `prompt` field correctly logs only the original user prompt.

---

**Conclusion for Task #1:**

The core conversation *continuation mechanism* is validated and working. However, the log verification revealed that the logging behavior (missing internal steps from the CID view, and raw XML in the final response field) needs to be addressed in **Task #2: Robust Synthesis Logging**.

Ready for the next task (Task #2).
