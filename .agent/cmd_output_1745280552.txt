Stdout/Stderr: # LLM Consortium

## Inspiration

Based on Karpathy's observation:

> "I find that recently I end up using all of the models and all the time. One aspect is the curiosity of who gets what, but the other is that for a lot of problems they have this 'NP Complete' nature to them, where coming up with a solution is significantly harder than verifying a candidate solution. So your best performance will come from just asking all the models, and then getting them to come to a consensus."

This plugin for the `llm` package implements a model consortium system with iterative refinement and response synthesis. It orchestrates multiple language models to collaboratively solve complex problems through structured dialogue, evaluation, and arbitration.

## Core Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Get Model Responses]
    B --> C[Synthesize Responses]
    C --> D{Check Confidence}
    D -- Confidence â‰¥ Threshold --> E[Return Final Result]
    D -- Confidence < Threshold --> F{Max Iterations Reached?}
    F -- No --> G[Prepare Next Iteration]
    G --> B
    F -- Yes --> E
```

## Features

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate responses from multiple models in parallel.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Automatically refine output until a confidence threshold is achieved.
- **Advanced Arbitration**: Uses a designated arbiter model to synthesize and evaluate responses.
- **Database Logging**: SQLite-backed logging of all interactions.
