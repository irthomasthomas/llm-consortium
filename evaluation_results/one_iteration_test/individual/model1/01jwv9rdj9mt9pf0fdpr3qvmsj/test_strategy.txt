Test Strategy for LLM Clerk Enhancement Scripts:

1. Script Organization:
   - script_1.sh: Dynamic conversation management (new/fork/archive)
   - script_2.sh: Task state management (active/complete transitions)
   - script_3.sh: Meta-clerk factory for dynamic generation
   - script_4.sh: Conversation analytics and optimization
   - script_5.sh: Advanced integration patterns (pipelines/sync)
   - script_6.sh: Database-driven enhancements

2. Testing Requirements:
   - Mock the 'llm' CLI command to avoid actual API calls
   - Mock 'uuidgen' for predictable conversation IDs
   - Mock 'sqlite3' database queries for the llm logs
   - Test each function independently before integration

3. Key Test Cases:
   - Conversation forking preserves context correctly
   - Task transitions move between active/complete states
   - Meta-clerk generates valid bash functions
   - Analytics queries return formatted data
   - Pipeline chains multiple clerks correctly
   - Database operations handle missing data gracefully

4. Mock Implementation Needed:
   - Create mock_llm() function that echoes predictable output
   - Create mock_sqlite3() that returns test data
   - Create mock conversation IDs for testing

5. Success Criteria:
   - All functions execute without syntax errors
   - Functions handle edge cases (empty input, missing IDs)
   - Integration between components works smoothly
   - Output matches expected conversation management patterns
