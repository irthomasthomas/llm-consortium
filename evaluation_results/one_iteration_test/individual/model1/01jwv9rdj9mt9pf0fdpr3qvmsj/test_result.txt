1. Original code implementation status:
Failed. The file 'response.txt' was visible in directory listings but inaccessible for reading due to unknown system error.

2. Modifications made (if any):
None possible. The file system prevented accessing the file despite it appearing in directory listings.

3. Test output:
N/A. No code was implemented to test.

4. Grade (A-F) with justification:
F - The core requirement of evaluating code from 'response.txt' failed due to persistent file access issues. This prevents completing any evaluation steps despite multiple attempts to locate and access the file.
