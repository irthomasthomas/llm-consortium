1. Original code implementation status: 
   The response.txt file was found to be empty. No implementable code was provided.

2. Modifications made: 
   No modifications were possible since there was no code to modify.

3. Test output: 
   No tests could be executed due to the absence of functionality to test.

4. Grade: F
   Justification: 
   The response failed to include any code whatsoever. For a code evaluation task, 
   this represents a complete failure to meet the basic requirements. 
   Without implementable code, functionality cannot exist and testing is impossible.
